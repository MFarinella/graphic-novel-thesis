### Page 1

"Once upon a time..."

"before the Orbiters lived in the sky,"

"before we hid underground to survive **THE BOILING**"

"we all lived together, on the Earth's surface."

"We could all breathe the air,"

"drink the water,"

"feel the sun."

"We were all... 

"FREE."

## Chapter 1

### Page 1

Backdrop: the glittery blackness of outer space. 

PA: "We are now arriving at **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**."

Small panel, upper left of the page: very close-up view of Min's closed eye. Her **SUBDERMAL SHIELD** is in stealth mode, mostly invisible except where it is pretending to be tendrils of hair cut into an elaborate shaved pattern; her clan tatoos, frozen in an imitation of an Earther **GANGIE**'s head tatoo. Just around her eye, we see shadows of her living e-syrup tatoo flickering with hints of her dreams. 

PA: "You may unbuckle your safety harnesses at this time."

Another small panel, floating just to the right and a little below the first panel: The eyelid cracks open and we see part of a dark, deep brown eye flecked with gold. A tendril of hair floats across Min's forehead - there is no longer enough gravity to hold it down. 

PA: "Please exercise caution while moving about the **SPACE BARGE**."

Two panels, the same size as the previous small panels, connected to each other and in the middle of the page: (on the left) Min's POV, looking down her belly at the harness buckle. (on the right) View from above Min's seat, as Min floats up above her seat, still half-asleep and holding her belly rather tenderly. 

PA: "The **SPACE BARGE** will dock at this station for 2 hours. Please collect all of your belongings before leaving the **BARGE**."

### Page 2

Upper left panel shows the typical icon for toilet facilities - **NEED TO DESIGN A TOILET ICON OF 2119**. Next panel: Zoom out to see Min, now wearing a large pack, exit the toilet facilities and lean against the wall with the sign; she still looks a bit groggy and disoriented. Next panel: We see Min in profile as she leans her head back against the wall, looking as if she is gathering her strength. Next 3 panels: Same perspective as previous panel, 1) Min's eyes snap open, and, looking more focused and alert, 2) she goes horizontal and 3) pushes off from the wall. 

Large panel, takes up the rest of the page: We see that the toilets were actually part of a large cylindrical tunnel, with shops, restaurants, pubs, toilets, etc, all the way around the cylinder, and a crowded stream of people either swimming through the center (few) or holding onto moving rails that have been elevated inwards, away from the outer walls of the transit tunnel (many). 

### Page 3

Small panel: Min is swimming through a station tunnel when she turns a corner and suddenly...

Large half page spread: ...comes upon a section of the tunnel with a large viewing port. Earth gleams below like a greasy, grubby marble in the spotlight. 

Small panels: We see Min swim down to press her face and hands against the viewing port, view from the space side of the viewing port. 

Next panel zooms in on her eyes, which are reflecting the Earth below and surrounded by shadowy e-syrup tatoos going wild, barely able to keep themselves invisible. 

#### Flashback 

All of the following panels are in a single row along the bottom of the page. 

Similar view as the last non-flashback view, except now Min's clan tatoos, rather fewer in density, dance freely about her face, and she has no subdermal shield. Her eyes, on a visibly younger face, are wide with fear and full of confused tears. It is night, and the scene flickers with fire light. 

Magou: "We will take NOTHING from the Orbiters."

View from the floor: we see a long corridor within a large e-syrup bubble, and Min's legs as she hides in the shadows of an e-syrup tapestry, one of many fabrics draped to serve as dividing walls. The tapestry embroidery depict various rituals of the Automata. 

Amadou: "So you let your BLIND HATRED for ORBITERS kill Jina? And who will win, if we lose our clan's greatest mathematician??" 

View from the other side of the tapestry that Min is hiding behind: We see half of her face, cautiously peeking around the fabric, as the flickering shadows of Amadou, Min's father, and Magou, Min's grandmother, darken the tapestry. 

Small panel in the bottom right corner, the sharp, sparking, wrinkled eyes of Magou: "I said NOTHING!!" 

### Page 4

#### Flashback continued

Tall panel, angle of view is opposite from where young Min stands, so that we see the scene and Min hiding in the background: Magou, hands serenely on her crossed knees, her back rigid and tall with cold, sad, despair, and her face turned away from Amadou, who on his hands and knees is at face level with the much shorter Magou. Amadou's fists grip the floor rugs, his face, turned down, is streaked with tears, and his broad shoulders are bent with exhaustion. 

Magou: "Always trying to PUSH the boundaries of our traditions. We are the Automata! We are Free! We do not beg for scraps from the ones who abandoned us to die on the surface!"

The following small panels take up diagonal rows that cover the right half of the page, leaving the left half of the page for the previous tall panel. 

Row 1:  

Small panel, zoomed in on Amadou, eyes closed as if to pray for patience.

Small panel, Amadou's now open eyes: "You're right. We took in João and his family at my urging..." 

Small panel, Min listening from her hiding place, fascinated, to Amadou: "But even you were thrilled to learn that others had made it back to the surface..."

Row 2:

Small panel, focused on Amadou's fists: "And they have been so generous with their knowledge..."

Small panel, we see Magou, her hands no longer so serene as they tighten on her knees. Off-panel, Amadou continues: "Then your daughter fell ill, and nothing we do helps. So when they confess to the possession of an Orbiter device, ONE WHICH COULD SAVE JINA'S LIFE..."

Small panel, back on Amadou's fiercely determined eyes: "we punish them, for what? Keeping it a secret from us?"

3 small square panels, lining the top of the page: 1) Magou squints her eyes and grits her teeth against tears of frustration; 2) Magou lowers her head, hiding her eyes, her mouth set in sad determination; 3) zoom in closer on the same image from previous panel as Magou whispers: "FINE. Use the Orbiter device. If Jina dies, João **MORIERA** and his family also die."

Larger panel that spans full width of page. Magou points her finger imperiously as we see Amadou steely-eyed yet still incredulous, and over his shoulder, Min's eyes as wide as saucers from behind the tapestry. Magou: "If Jina heals, they will have 7 days to leave our clan and never contact us again."

### Page 5

#### Back on the **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**

Three small square panels in a row that spans the width of the page: We see Min's ear, with just barely visible shadows of her e-syrup tatoos writhing, as a warning siren of station emergency medical services wails in the distance. As we see Min's eyes turn from the viewing port to check for the source of the sound, she gets bumped hard enough to knock her head into the viewing port. From behind her, out of panel, a distant mechanical voice cries: "Whoops, sorry!"

Large panel spanning the width of the page: Min turns to see a tall teen, gangly limbs fully covered in the traditional multi-layers of the BIOSILICA cult, tumbling through a crowd as people swim out of the way of an emergency medical team and their floater (vehicle). The teen holds a large cup of drink in one hand, straw disappearing into the folds of their face mask, while ineffectually flailing with the other hand. A cuttlefish mechapet floats nearby and holds on for dear life, with amorphous arms clinging to the teen's neck, shoulders, and head. The e-syrup embroidery along the front of the teen's face mask rearrenges itself into large letters that spell "Sorry!"

Tall rectangular panel: View of Min, from below, as she stares up at the tall BIOSILICA teen with slight dumbfoundedness, one hand still on the viewing port. In the viewing port behind Min we see the reflection of the BIOSILICA teen as a dense crowd of people start to laugh and some try to help her re-stabilize, while the rest of the crowd try to keep moving towards their own destinations, all while leaving a path for the emergency medical services.

Tall rectangular panel: The BIOSILICA teen is now being towed by her free hand by some friendly older Orbiters. The teen takes a loud slurp of drink through the straw. The wail of the emergency medical services as it leaves passes behind the scene. 

2 wide panels, full width of page: The crowd begins to disperse. The BIOSILICA teen looks over their shoulder with a new message on the mask: "Thanks everyone!" The cuttlefish mechapet, now being towed along, happily gurgles: "Wheehaveanicedaaaay!"

Bottom of the page: Min stares after the BIOSILICA teen, then shakes herself out of her reverie. She pushes off from the tunnel wall, aiming to swim in the opposite direction. 

### Page 6 and 7

Min finds the platform for the school shuttle. The entrance to the platform is guarded by World Government Security Wardens, who are scanning everyone entering the platform for illegal substances and unregistered e-syrup products. 

#### Flashback

Min, on her way to the Space Barge station to leave Earth, stops by a black market drug dealer to buy a substance that when injected, will render her e-syrup tatoos undetectable by World Government standard issue scanners for 24 hours. Min has learned the circuitry of a chemical scanner, and uses it to verify the chemical components of the substance. The whole time, though, Min in stressed and the dealer is stone-faced. 

#### back to the **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**

Min casually rubs the side of her neck, where we can see a tiny pinprick of an injection needle. She squares her shoulders and approaches the platform gate and the Wardens and the scanners. She shows them her documents proving that she is a scholarship student at the ISE Corps, includes a view of her temporary student ID with *"Guild Assignment: Undecided"* prominently in view, and passes through without incident. 

### Page 8

Min boards the shuttle and gasps - the walls and floor are covered in organic material, hardwood and brick, textile and ceramic. She runs her hands along the hardwood wall paneling as she remembers living and working in the trees on Earth as a Tree Surfer.

An announcement over the PA: "This is the ISE Space Shuttle to Gemini, headquarters of the ISE Corps. You must carry a valid student ID in order to use this shuttle. Otherwise, you may be charged a penalty fare, or asked to leave."

Min wanders the shuttle until she finds the cafe compartment. Her guts still feel unsteady, so she gets a cup of hot tea and takes it to a seat next to another viewing port. 

Over the PA: "This is the ISE Space Shuttle terminating at Gemini Station, calling at ... **NAME SOME OTHER STATIONS HERE**"

As she sips her tea, she stares down at Earth and falls into another remembrance. 

PA: "We will be departing in 10 minutes."

### Page 9

#### Flashback

Bonfires on a warm night. Shadows of well-choreographed ritual dancers, powerful and strong from a lifetime of training, hover warmly, protectively. 

**"Another Tree Surfer is born tonight."**

Over this backdrop, small close-up panels are scattered, showing different parts of 16 year old Min, a year before she leaves Earth, large swaths of skin covered in proudly displayed, ecstatically dancing clan tatoos:   
* an eye, nose, and ear. The eye, of Korean - West African - Brazilian descent, is determined, steely, and dilated with adrenaline and euphoria. The nose and ear are pierced with e-syrup metal, formed into plain, elegantly raw shapes with rounded edges. The brow is set and only slightly sweaty. The head is shaved and covered in tatoos of her achievements as a clan member and Arborist. 
* a strong and straight back, dominated by an e-syrup tatoo depicting a shallow coral ocean scene, ever-changing.  
* shoulder and neck from the front, collar bone straight in a relaxed line that is perfectly parallel to the bottom edge of the panel. Neck is a bit clenched, and tendrils of Min's back tatoo curl around from her back in comforting, fractal patterns.  
* legs, covered in line art encoding her family lineage, are folded in an easy lotus, covered in the soft folds of ritual clothing appropriate for the ascent of a Journeyhume Arborist to the status of Expert Crafter: Tree Surfer. 

Bottom of the page, larger panel, full width of the page: the view zooms out so that we see Min from above. Min is topless, sitting inside a large, fat metal hoop, a la Cyr Wheel. She is surrounded in many concentric circles of family and friends, all dressed in their most splendid clothing made of cloth infused with one of the AUTOMATA's original, surviving e-syrup cultures, called "Mothers". Everyone in the concentric circles are holding hands and focused on Min, their bodies convulsing in synchronised group ritual dance. 

Drum beats keep everyone synchronised. 

**"To be reborn, each Expert Crafter of the Automata must accept a MOTHER into their FULL SKIN."**

### Page 10

#### Flashback continued 

3 panels show close-up views of the people in the inner most circle, just on the outside of the metal hoop:  
* Jina and Amadou, also covered in clan tatoos and splendid e-syrup ritual clothing. Jina's subdermal shield, marking her as an Expert Crafter, dance triumphantly in shadowy patterns under the clan tatoos. Next to her is a tall, beautiful e-syrup metal bucket, holding ritual clensing water.    
* Magou, matriarch leader of their clan, subdermal shield barely visible beneath the many clan tatoos. She is proud, stern, and exhuberant on this day of achievement by her granddaughter.  
* **MARABA**, Min's cousin and dearest childhood companion, now an Expert Crafter: **INKER** and chosen for the honour of injecting Min's subdermal shield. Next to **MARABA**, in a shallow curving basket woven from e-syrup kevlar, is an enormous syringe full of swirling, bubbling, living e-syrup culture, freshly harvested from one of their living Mothers. 

Wide panel, full width: **"DOOOOHM!"** The drums all come to a halt, and all of the concentric circles except the innermost lean in sharply on that last booming beat, hands all stretched towards Min, fingers shaking. 

Jina, Amadou, Magou, and **MARABA** all stand up and pick up the metal hoop. They hold it in place as Min steps onto the curving metal, hands pushing against the hoop above her head. Then they strap Min's ankles and wrists to the metal hoop. 

### Page 11

#### Flashback continued

**MARABA** picks up the syringe as Jina picks up the bucket of water, leaving Magou and Amadou to hold the hoop with Min inside steady. 

Jina pours the bucket of water slowly over Min until Min is drenched, then returns the bucket to its precies, previous location in the circle. Then **MARABA** positions the needle of the syringe full of living e-syrup against Min's right buttcheek, breaks the skin, and slowly injects all of the e-syrup as Min grits her teeth. 

Min's cousin pulls out the syringe and places it back on the basket. Then Jina, Amadou, Magou, and **MARABA** turn Min in slow circles as the living e-syrup spreads throughout her body, spreading up her torso, across her arms and legs, over her face, into her eyelids and nose and mouth. As the subdermal shield continues down her throat to line her lungs and gut, Min begins to cough and gag. 

Her body convulses as her inner circle turns her a few more times in the Cyr wheel, then they set her upright in the very center again. The crowd chants "Be Free! Be FREE! BE FREE!" as Min finishes integrating the subdermal shield. After a tense moment, Min focuses her subdermal awareness to sprout razor sharp spikes at her wrists and ankles, cutting her bonds. 

### Page 12

#### Flashback continued

View from above: Min is on her knees, curled into a fetal position, cradling her bleeding wrists and ankles while her back tatoo writhes in distress. Jina, Amadou, and Magou gently place the hoop back down in its exact previous position, centering Min again. 

Magou stands at her original position in the inner circle and shouts: "Minka Oosou, daughter of Jina and Amadou, Tree Surfer of the Automata!"

View of Min from the front, gasping, blinking away large beads of sweat from her eyes as she looks up at her grandmother and clan leader.  

Magou's eyes, proud, confident, expectant: "WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE FREE?"

Min closes her eyes, tries to calm her breathing, struggling to stand: "To drink without bleeding, to breathe without choking, to see the sky and greet the day in my own skin..."

Min throws her head up and cries: "...and to MOVE in any direction with curiosity and grace..."

Zoom in on Min's mouth, exhausted yet serene, wry, and just a tiny bit cheeky: "...even OFF THE PLANET!"

## Chapter 2

### Page 1

We're back on the ISE Space Shuttle to Gemini Station. Min is still in the cafe compartment, which is now much busier. She stares out the window as the curvature of the Earth slowly rotates under the shuttle. 

PA: "This is **THE MAE JEMISON MEMORIAL** station. Change here for **MAKE UP SOME ROUTES AND STUFF**. The next station is **SOMETHING SOMETHING**. This shuttle terminates at Gemini Station." 

Behind Min, who is still nursing a hot tea and her stomach while hidden behind her large pack in her corner booth by the viewing port, a crowd of mostly Orbiters have gathered in small groups throughout the cafe compartment. The Orbiters have thin legs, very large puffy heads, and wear full-body e-syrup leotards, which act as an exoskeleton to help support their posture and compensate for the bone loss they experience, growing up and living their lives in space. Their faces are naked, and many of them already have World Government standard issue mods in their necks for space masks. 

The Orbiters all throw sidelong glances at a small group of Earthers, whose bulkier bodies were clearly developed under the influence of stronger gravity. But they also look different from Min - their backs are hunched from living their lives in underground tunnels, their skin is ghostly pale, and all of them have also been surgically equipped with World Government standard issue e-syrup body modifications, which stretch their pale skin paper thin and cast dark bruise-like shadows. Some of the Earthers, mostly from military or academia families, also find room to be disdainful and superior towards the **GANGIE** Earthers, identifiable by their elaborate head tatoos, who tend to be from the lowest castes in the great underground World Government cities. 

PA: "Please exercise caution while moving about the shuttle."

A distant commotion by the bar. An Earther **GANGIE** teen, with a body covered in mods and cautious, defensive eyes, has apparently knocked over the drink of a petite Orbiter girl and got her drink all over her. 

Petite Orbiter girl: "Wha--! Well excuse you!"

Earther **GANGIE**: "What? You were standing in the middle of the path."

Petite Orbiter: "What path, we're standing at the bar!"

During this scene, the panels are focused on Min, who is watching with bored eyes from over her hot cup of tea.

### Page 2

The Orbiter and Earther **GANGIE** continue to bicker in the background, as we see Min turn back to the viewing port. Behind her, a body dressed in the multi-layered clothing of the BIOSILICA cult appear. The body places the softest of finger-tip touch onto Min's back and whispers: *"Mini?"*

We see Min's eyes, reflected in the viewing port, grow wide as the reflection shows a vague figure. 

Zoom in on Min's mouth, curved up in a triumphant grin: *"You made it!!!"*

Our attention shifts to the fight happening at the bar. Earther **GANGIE** reaches over to a not-quite cleared table to grab a mostly unused napkin while simultaneously grabbing Petite Orbiter's hand and starts to mop up the spilled drink on her hand: "Look, I'm really so--"

Petite Orbiter yanks her hand away and says coldly: "Don't touch me." 

Earther **GANGIE**: "What, I'm trying to--"

Petite Orbiter: "THAT'S NOT CLEAN, DON'T TOUCH ME WITH IT!!" This moment draws everyone's attention in the cafe.

### Page 3

Some other Orbiters come over and push the Earther **GANGIE** away: "Hey why don't you leave her alone?" "Just stop!" "Leave, Muskie!" 

Earther **GANGIE** gets immediately wild-eyed and says, soft and deadly: "You guys wanna fight?!"

As some of Earther **GANGIE**'s friends perk their ears and start to turn towards the scene, Petite Orbiter cries: "What?? No!"

Earther **GANGIE** presses a small grey canister into a body mod port on his neck, and his legs suddenly puff up, get more defined, his arms also get more buff, and an already sturdy-looking human is now pumped up like a body builder: "Fight me!!"

With a roar, several other Orbiters and Earther **GANGIES** press similar canisters into their necks, suddenly pump up, and throw themselves at each other. 

Everyone else looks on in serene befuddlement, and we see that even Min and the BIOSILICA teen can't help but stare. 

Petite Orbiter has also pressed a capsule into the mod port at her neck in an attempt to stay safe in a suddenly escalated situation, but her transformation isn't going smoothly. Her body wobbles and inflates in a rather chaotic manner for a few seconds, then everything deflates and the Petite Orbiter heaves an enormous vomit. People around her scatter away as fast as they can, knocking over more drinks. As she stumbles to get away from the fight, she turns and runs into the tall BIOSILICA teen. Min is on her feet by now.

Min to Petite Orbiter: "Are you alright?"

Petite Orbiter looks up at Min, pained and desperate, as the BIOSILICA teen places a hand on her shoulder to steady her. Then the Petite Orbiter heaves another vomit. 

### Page 4

The original Earther **GANGIE** who knocked Petite Orbiter's drink has finally noticed where Petite Orbiter ended up, and shouts: "Hey!" Min looks up to see him rushing over, intent on fighting Petite Orbiter. Min tries to warn the BIOSILICA teen and the Petite Orbiter: "Watch out--!"

But the Earther **GANGIE** is blind with chemically-amplified fury and approaching too fast. Min steps in front of BIOSILICA teen and Petite Orbiter to grab his punching arm and throws his weight over her hip. He crashes into the cafe booth. 

Min, furious: "Can't you see she's sick?" In the background, BIOSILICA teen is completely holding up Petite Orbiter. 

Earther **GANGIE**: "Why do you care?! Whose crew are you on anyway??" He runs a wild eye judgmentally over Min as he tries struggles to stand. His upper lip curls in a cruel smirk: "A mod virgin??" 

Min's brow furrows at the derogatory term. Earther **GANGIE** says, off-panel: "No wonder you're useless!"

Tendril-like arms of a mechapet cuttlefish deftly twist out the grey capsule at Earther **GANGIE**'s neck with a soft *"KWUSSSSSSHHHHH"*. Earther **GANGIE**: "What the--!"

An inky, blobulous cuttlefish mechapet, floating behind the Earther **GANGIE**'s head, swallows the grey capsule with a happy gurgle. While munching the mechapet happily explains: "I love **WHAMO!**!"

Without the WHAMO! capsule, the Earther **GANGIE** deflates quickly, and starts to shiver; furiously: "That's not fair you **FRACKIN** robot!" Meanwhile, mecha-cleaners have rushed over and start sucking up Petite Orbiter's vomit. She looks almost ill again, watching the cleaning robots seemingly slurp up her vomit, so BIOSILICA teen tries to turn her away.

PA, frantic, as other Orbiters and Earther **GANGIES** continue to brawl: "Will passengers please note that physical violence will not be tolerated on this shuttle service! Will passengers please note that physical viole--"

The PA interrupts itself with a familiar ding: "We are now approaching **SOMETHING SOMETHING**. Exit here for the ISE Space Orchestra Conservatory."

### Page 5

#### In a quieter compartment of the shuttle...

We see Min's hand with Petite Orbiter's capsule, holding it out as she says: "Here, eat this too."

Mecha-tentacles snag the capsule and bring it back to a delighted cuttlefish mechapet. 

Petite Orbiter, seated, is digging frantically through her bag as BIOSILICA teen holds the bag for her. Petite Orbiter finally produces an anti-nausea pill, then her face falls as she looks around and mumbles, "**FRACK** I have no water..."

Min cheekily produces 3 hilariously tiny bottles of water in one hand and a stack of fresh napkins with a grin: "Fizzy water nicked from the cafe?" 

Wide panel: the 3 teens, sitting side-by-side in the shuttle seats. Petite Orbiter sits in the middle, anti-nausea pill packaging crumpled in one hand, head tilted back as she guzzles the fizzy water clenched in her other hand, eyes closed, breathing hard. Min holds the stack of napkins while looking out the viewing port in this compartment, legs crossed in her seat and looking rather pleased with herself. The BIOSILICA teen sits with legs folded on top of their seat, cuttlefish mechapet happily munching the rest of Petite Orbiter's capsule as BIOSILICA teen pats it on the head.

Petite Orbiter finishes the fizzy water and collapses into the shuttle seat. Still looking up at the ceiling, she says a bit begrudgingly: "Thank you for your help. Taking WHAMO! was a terrible idea...I don't know why I thought it would help..."

Min, handing Petite Orbiter the stack of fresh napkins: "Is that what's in those capsules?"

Petite Orbiter nods and wipes her face: "Have you never seen anyone using uppers before? I guess you are a mod vir-- I mean, you don't have an body mods..." 

Min's shakes her head while looking down: "You know, your friends kinda suck. None of them stopped fighting to even check on you."

Rhee's hands tighten in angry fists as she sneers: "Those ANIMALS aren't my friends. All they want is the next trendy mod and whatever psycho-stims they can get their rich, privileged hands on. I don't know ANYBODY here."

### Page 6

Min looks at Rhee for a second, then smiles and says: "Well now you know me. I'm Minka Oosou, Tree Surfer of the Automata."

Rhee gives a loud sniff, cleans her tears and blows her nose with the remaining napkins, then sits up tall: "I'm Rhee of the **SEPPELLITORI** guild, Vela quadrant. Thank you for helping me." Innocently curious sidelong glance: "Which gang is the Automata? I don't recognize your head tatoo..."

Min: "How would you know what **GANGIE** head tatoos look like?"

Rhee looks sad and guilty and looks down again: "My parents are morticians for several large space construction companies, and they usually hire **GANGIES** as cheap labor...so I've seen lots of head tatoos..."

Min, suddenly angry and proud and surprising herself with the fire in her voice: "That's why the Automata take nothing from Orbiters! We work for ourselves, and live free on the surface!"

Rhee looks surprised: "There are humans living on the planet's surface?" Eyes widen. "That's why I've heard the term Automata...when I was little my grandpa told me that the World Government discovered a hidden civilization of nomadic humans on the surface, who somehow survived the Water Crisis and were living outside the law...that's you!"

Min, appeased but a bit embarrassed to have been part of someone's childhood stories: "Yeah, but...it's not...as glamorous as it sounds..."

Rhee: "Oh, yeah probably not..."

### Page 7

The cuttlefish mechapet belches, breaking the awkward silence. Min and Rhee stare, then they both start to laugh. 

Rhee, looking at BIOSILICA teen while reaching a hand towards the mechapet: "May I?"

BIOSILICA teen nods as the mechapet eagerly stretches out its arms to Rhee: "I'm Iri, I like you!"

After a moment of scratches and head pats, Rhee draws her head back from petting Iri and tilts her head curiously at the BIOSILICA teen.

Rhee: "I've heard of people who dress like you, and have mechapet companions...are you a follower of the Biosilica religion?"

BIOSILICA teen nods their head silently as the front of their mask spells out, "Yes." 

Rhee: "I heard that Biosilicans only use their voices for religious rituals and with members of their family...is that true?"

BIOSILICA teen nods again. 

Rhee: "So are there any deaf Biosilicans?"

BIOSILICA teen's mask rearranges to spell, "Of course!"

Rhee: "Then how...?"

Iri, giggling: "You have more senses than your eyes and ears!"

The BIOSILICA teen extends a hand palm forward to Rhee, a ghost of a smile visible beneath the teen's face mask. After a moment of confusion, Rhee puts her palm against the BIOSILICA teen's hand, who presses against Rhee's hand as Rhee suddenly looks as if she's being lightly electrocuted.

Rhee: "Aaah! ...oh wow, that was weird!" Rhee stares at her hand.

Then Rhee looks up at the BIOSILICA teen with a grin: "Pleased to meet you, Asoka of Green Haven Hibernia!" Iri claps two of its arms in celebration and looks enormously pleased. 

### Page 8

PA: "We are now approaching Gemini Station, home of the International Space Exploration Corps. This will be the final stop of this shuttle service."

Min to Rhee: "You alright then?"

Rhee: "I'm fine now. Thanks to both of you, again."

Min stands and says: "If we're almost there I guess I should get my stuff out of the shuttle luggage lockers...do you know where we go when we dock?"

Rhee frowns: "Did you not get a message from your guild?"

Min shakes her head: "I'm Unassigned. Do you have a guild already?"

Rhee: "Yeah, I'll be studying with the **MENDELEEVERS**." To Soka: "You?"

Soka's face mask reads, "**CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE**".

Rhee, turning back to Min: "I've heard of folks occassionally being Unassigned by the time they get to ISE Corps, but then I don't know where you'd go on your first day..."

PA: "We are now arriving at Gemini Station. This is the final stop of this shuttle service. All change ple--"

The pre-recorded announcement is interrupted by a live announcement: "This is an announcement for all first-year cadets. Welcome to the ISE Corps! Please check your temporary student ID for your guild assignment, and follow signs to the appropriate docking bay door."

All three teens stare up at the speaker. 

We see just the speaker in the panel as the live announcement continues: "If you are Unassigned, please report to docking bay door 0813. Once again, if you are Unassigned, please report to docking bay door 0813." 

### Page 9

Zoomed out, bird's eye view of the Gemini Station receiving platform. Hundreds of new students, mostly Orbiters, stream out of the shuttle with their luggage, some in small groups of friends. 

We zoom in on Min, carrying a large e-syrup-fabric pack on her back, stuffed to the brim. 

We see a sign: *"DOCKING BAY DOORS 0800 - 0820"*

Min peers around the docking bay door and sees a small gathering of other Unassigned students. On a raised platform at the opposite end as the docking bay door, two older Orbiter teens wearing the shoulder guards of 3rd year cadets (Zalo and Jheri) stand looking over the group. The other Unassigned students are mostly Earther **GANGIES**, including the one that was in a fight with Rhee earlier; some Earther **NORMIES**; and 2 other BIOSILICA teens with mechapets, but neither are the BIOSILICA teen from earlier, and neither have a cuttlefish mechapet. 

Zalo: "Hello! Welcome! You must be..." He consults the a diagram of faces and text floating beside him.

Zalo: "...Minka Oosou?"

Min, walking into the docking bay and putting down her pack: "Yup."

Zalo: "Great!" 

### Page 10

Close up on Jheri and Zalo: "Welcome everyone! I'm Jheri, 3rd year cadet with the **CYBERPHILIA** guild, and this is Zalo, 3rd year cadet with the **INFRADESTRUCTORS** guild. We are this year's Assignment Counselors, meaning we are here to help you get a guild assignment before the end of the week!" 

Jheri: "A guild assignment is a mutual pledge of respect and commitment to study the skills and protect the secrets of your guild. Usually, we would rely on the data in your Universal Record to assign you to the optimal guild, based your life choices and achievements. But since, for one reason or another," and here Jheri smiles kindly, gently looking each first-year in the eye, "your Universal Records have insufficient data to calculate the optimal placement, you will spend the first week of the semester meeting each guild and taking some of their classes."

Jheri's eyes grow both sad and hard: "If you cannot find a guild to accept you and commit to teaching you their ways, there will be no room for you at this school, and you will have to go home."

An Earther **NORMIE**: "But, wait, what if we're part of the Space Asylum Program? We have no home to go back to!"

Jheri looks terribly apologetic and says quietly: "If no guild will accept you, your scholarship will be void."

A wave of anxious whispers briefly rumbles through the gathered first-years: "But wait, then what about the bursary they promised my family?" "Wasn't last year's drop-out rate something insane, like 40%??" "Why can't we take a drop-out's assignment?" "You mean no one is obligated to teach us, even though we made it this far?" "Your recruitment material is deliberately misleading!"

Min finds Asoka and Rhee at dinner. The food is trendy and more-ish but unhealthy and awful. All three are horrified and wonder how they will make it through the week, much less the whole training program. Afterwards, Rhee and Soka head off to their respective guild dormitories. Min, as a scholarship student, must report to the Service Crew Head Office in order to fulfill the work-study requirements of her scholarship. 

Min gets to the Service Crew Head Office meets PQ, a proud and stern, much older Earther **GANGIE** who coordinates the scholarship students with the full-time service crew of Gemini Station. PQ gives a quick welcome/intro speech outlining expectations for scholarship students...

... when suddenly, Min's chest burns, her stomach seizes, and her scalp throbs. Her clan tatoos writhe for a second, explosively, unable to stay frozen in the fake head tatoo. PQ helps Min sit, gives her some water, and lets Min's breathing return to normal before saying...

PQ, eyes unfathomable: "Your head tatoo...it's fake."

Min clenches her teeth and begins to sweat: "I've just had a bad reaction to zero-G, that's all."

PQ: "No, I know what you are..."

PQ: "YOU'RE AN AUTOMATA." 

Min: "So? Does your gang have business with mine?"

PQ's face softens and PQ chuckles suddenly: "Child, do not be afraid, I know that the Automata aren't just another Earther gang."

Min, suddenly angry because she feels she is being patronized: "You don't know anything about us!"

PQ: "Oh, but I do. You know why?"

Dramatic zoom into PQ's face: "Because an Automata once saved my life."

## Dream: The Night of a Thousand Burning Stars (2 pages)

PQ was part of a pioneering group of humans who were amongst the first generation to live in space. Most of these people were **GANGIES** with not many prospects on Earth, who were desperate for a change in their situation. But the first generation of space craft and orbiting structures had many bugs and kinks that still needed to be worked out. PQ was commuting in one of the Space Barges that exploded during the Night of a Thousand Burning Stars. Everyone on board was wearing protective e-syrup suits, but they weren't designed to keep people falling through the atmosphere alive. PQ was lucky and managed to survive the fall long enough to be discovered by a young Magou, who kept PQ alive by secretly giving PQ a partial injection of living e-syrup. Magou then helps PQ return to the underground cities. 

## Chapter 3

### Page 1

It's the next day, first day of classes. We see the entrance to a large workspace, hand made banner above the entrance proudly labeling the space as **"INFRADESTRUCTORS workspace 267"**. From inside, Zalo's voice can be heard saying: "...so if you open this panel..."

Next panel, we are inside the workspace, bird's eye view. We see Zalo standing at a large workbench surrounded by first-year cadets, including Min. Zalo is holding up flat device about the size of a short, fat finger, which has been opened up so that the inner circuitry is visible. 

Zalo: "You can see how this World Government medical scanner has two fixed e-syrup circuits - one for measuring small changes in skin resistance, the other for measuring small concentrations of specific chemicals in bodily fluid samples."

POV is now in front of Zalo, who now holds up a similarly shaped and sized device, also opened up. The insides of this second device is way more chaotic and rough, definitely looks like a work in progress. 

Zalo: "This is a prototype for a POCKET UNIVERSAL SCANNER..."

We see numerous panels showing close-ups of the workspace, with tools and materials typical of an electrical workshop, chemistry wet lab, plumbing equipment and tools, field biology equipment, etc. Over these panels, Zalo's voice continues: "...ideally, it can give electrical and chemical readings of other animal species, plants, objects, anything you could possibly want to scan!" 

Zalo: "So today's challenge is to debug this prototype, and learn how to morph e-syrup! Careful though, you only get 2 or 3 morphs out of an e-syrup circuit, 4 if you're very lucky!"

### Page 2

View of the mess hall. 

Min: "I didn't realise so many Orbiter products use e-syrup circuits! It's everywhere!"

Zalo, Min, and a few other **INFRADESTRUCTOR** cadets are seated together. Most of them have finished eating and they are philosophising over lunch. 

An Earther **NORMIE** cadet: "Yeah, it really makes me want to get body mods..."

Zalo taps his utensil on his plate thoughtfully: "But you know, it's a real pain in the ass to be tied to Government standard issue body mods, which have at most 4 morphs available. In theory, living e-syrup should be able to go through an infinite number of morphs - think of all the crazy mods we COULD make, one that could last our whole lives!"

An Earther **GANGIE** cadet: "But then who will make sure that the mods are safe?" 

Zalo, looking meaningfully at the cadet: "Do you really think that every mod we have out now is perfectly safe?"

### Page 3

Earther **NORMIE**, shivers: "Ugh, definitely not! I've seen people have some CRAZY reactions to capsule stims..."

Earther **GANGIE**, grim faced: "True. But THOSE are so dangerous because there's so much money in making chem mods, and the laws about honest labeling have no teeth. No one actually gets punished when their products melt the mod ports or poison you with bad filtering." 

Sedii, an Orbiter cadet, leans in conspiratorially: "Well, and also because the government forbits basic research into e-syrup, so no one even knows enough what they're doing when they make the mods to be able to write accurate labels."

Earther **GANGIE** cadet, bitter: "Yeah, what better way to keep humanity stupid, enslaved, and easy to control." 

Sedii: "Exactly! Isn't it CRAZY how e-syrup seems to be a crucial part of all of our devices, our homes, our transportation, in fact, our entire space-faring infrastructure, and yet no one seems to know how the fundamental ingredient works?" 

Zalo: "I heard that before the Water Crisis, e-syrup was considered a cute biological engineering project, and the original inventors published the entire recipe for living e-syrup ON THE INTERNET..."

Sedii: "Ha! Yeah, back when humans thought the internet would exist forever..."

Min: "But, Zalo, are you trying to tell us that the **INFRADESTRUCTORS** guild ISN'T trying to research living e-syrup? That's what I thought you meant by 'opening up all black boxes'..."

Zalo: "Ok, sure, but no guild is powerful enough to openly defy World Government law..."

### Page 4

Scene changes to the hallway outside PQ's office, where Min and the other scholarship students stand, waiting to be called in.

From inside the office door we hear PQ: "Next, Minka and Rajue!"

The Earther **GANGIE** from the shuttle cafe fight peels himself from off the wall and gives Min a murderous look as he walks through PQ's office door. Min enters unenthusiastically behind him. 

Large panel, whole bottom half of the page: We see PQ standing next to a floating 3-dimensional schematic of the Gemini Station. The locations of all toilets are highlighted and labeled. PQ is holding two buckets with mop and cleaning solutions stuffed inside. PQ says, cheerfully: "You two will be on toilet duty today!"

### Page 5

In a bathroom somewhere on the Gemini...Min wipes down a mirror covered in foamy cleaning solution as Rajue fiddles with the timer device that controls the self-cleaning toilet bowls. 

Rajue, not looking at Min: "I've asked around. No one knows your head tats."

Min: "Oh yeah?"

Rajue: "Which leads me to 2 possible conclusions - either your gang is so puny and unknown that it's not even worth beating the shit out of you..."

We see Min's face reflecting well-contained but visible anger as Rajue continues: "...or your head tat's a fake!"





On Day 2, Min joins the **CYBERPHILIA** guild for their classes. Min bonds with many on this crew over a shared love of anime, live improvisational music, and mechapets, as Biosilicans most often end up in this guild. The Earther **GANGIE** who attacked Rhee is also in this guild (Rajue), who loudly wonders how any mod-virgin will be able to do anything worthwhile in the **CYBERPHILIA** guild. 

Jheri teaches the cadets how to use the laser atomic manipulator (LAM), which allows them to perform surgeries so precise that they can cut out a 1cm cubed volume out from deep inside of a living animal without causing bleeding or needing stitches. Jheri is currently considered one of the top cadets at ISE Corps, in large part for her incredible dexterity and precision with the LAM. She has already begun her Journeyhume training with a Space University professor, who invented the most recent version of the LAM, which is an order of magnitude cheaper and more portable.

## Chapter 4

On Day 3 Min joins the **CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE** guild, where 3rd-year cadet **GIARMO** is leading the day's physical training. Min quickly falls in love with the **CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE**'s training and performance spaces, their lovingly maintained aquariums and terrariums, and their movement focused lifestyle and mentality. After a morning of rigorous drills, they break for water and fruit before they play games on the playgrounds the crew builds for themselves, a combination of capoeira, parkour, and numerous East Asian martial arts traditions. By lunch Min is exhausted but exhilerated. In the afternoon, Asoka brings Min to her "Animal Husbandry in Space" course, where teacher Adi, a professor on the teaching staff of "Health and Well-being in Space" at Space University, entertains them with stories of research animals on space vessels escaping their designated areas. After the lecture they watch Iri play with biological cephalopods in the aquaculture tanks, and Asoka reveals that she's been teaching Iri to change not just her color and texture, but also her entire body shape, such that Iri can squeeze through any size gap, or can balloon and expand to protectively engulf Asoka. Asoka demonstrates her kinetic linguistics skills by having a brief conversation with the cephalopods in the aquaculture tanks.

It's Day 4, and the Undecideds are with the MENDELEEVERS, where ISS Corps alum Tross is giving a demonstration of space welding tools as fellow 2nd- and 3rd-year MENDELEEVERS cadets play rapid fire rounds of "What if...in space?!", in which a situation is invented in which something breaks out in space, and no internet is available, and very few technologically optimized tools are available, and thus one must macgyver a solution using un-networked tools. Tross's ESYRUP DAEMON, a midnight black, silky, sinewy cat named INQBI, alternates between curling around Tross's shoulders like an adorable, purring scarf, to gliding through the shadows like a silent, hazel-eyed wave of death and destruction. Min finds Tross's teaching style incredibly exciting and asks such eager questions that Tross and Min continue chatting over lunch, where Min also finds Rhee. Min and Rhee become fast friends with INQBI, who shares their fondness for fried cheese. Min's head tatoo flares up again, and Tross asks Min if she's alright. She explains that she might have some mild ESYRUP contamination, but she's gotten some pills to help with it. Tross asks her several probing questions about the pills and expresses concern over some of the active ingredients. Tross then excuses himself, saying that he needs to return to Space University now.

## Chapter 5

After lunch, Rhee introduces Min to Oana, another NORMIE and a scholarship student in her 2nd year, who has become an expert at blowing microscopic bio-compatible ESYRUP-infused glass filaments, which can be gently embedded subdermally to create programmable, interactive "mod-makeup". It's not quite like ESYRUP tatoos - the ESYRUP in the glass filaments have only limited input from the biological tissue and are programmed prior to injection. Oana shows them how to verify each piece to certify it safe for subdermal injection. While they work, Rhee teases Min for her fascination with Tross. Oana reveals that Tross was a muskie during the same year as Zalo and Jheri, but he is the first and only cadet to graduate in one year - most students take the full 3, and occassionally someone graduates in 2 years. Tross is now a 2nd-year journeyhume at Space University as an independent space welder, but he returns to the ISS Corps for the first week of the year, to be part of the initiation week and hold workshops and demonstrations for the MENDELEEVERS. Rhee also confesses a fascination with understanding the fundamental workings of ESYRUP, and encourages Min to ask Oana about her ESYRUP contamination. Oana listens to Min's symptoms, examines her head tatoo, and suggests talking to someone from INFRADESTRUCTORS to help her learn more about her pills.

On Day 5, Min spends the morning with the INFRADESTRUCTORS crew, trying to de-black-box her pills. They make some startling discoveries with the POCKET UNIVERSAL SCANNER, which make Zalo wonder if Min should stop taking the pills altogether.

At lunch, Min catches up with Rhee and Oana about her morning session with the INFRADESTRUCTORS. After lunch, she joins Rhee for a workshop on "Common chemicals on space vessels with surprising properties", where Rhee proves to be a natural at chemical alchemy. After the workshop, Min spies INQBI disappearing around a corner. Follwing INQBI in the hopes of running into Tross, she steps into a workroom where she sees what looks like a delicate metal flower on the workbench. She goes in for a closer look, when Tross suddenly appears and asks what Min is doing. He tries to encourage her to leave, but Min is fascinated by the flower and wants to learn more about it. Tross tells Min to forget the flower, claiming that it is a failed experiment that will get incinerated anyway. Min asks to take the flower, under the logic that she will happily investigate the "failed experiment", especially if no one else wants it. Tross refuses to give it to her and tries to physically remove her from the room, but of course Min doesn't stand for that. As their grappling becomes more earnest, one of the surveillance cameras catches the violence and an alarm goes off. Tross grips Min hard and says, deadly serious, "Min, if you value your life, leave right now." Utterly shaken, Min flees.

## Chapter 6

Min spends Day 6 with Asoka and the CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE crew. She had slept in Asoka's sleeping structure the night before, she was so confused and frightened by Tross's behaviour. She and Asoka had discussed it until late into the night, and now, the next day, she just wants to shut up the questions in her head with blindingly difficult physical challenges, so she and Asoka work on space swimming drills until they reach lunch time, exhausted. Everyone is super excited by how quickly Min's space swimming is improving, especially Asoka, who has been training space swimming since childhood and is eager to involve Min in her experiments in multi-partner synchronized space swimming, which could be a new way to accomplish certain build and maintenance tasks for space vessels in orbit or during space travel. Min spends a wonderful lunch with Asoka, GIARMO, and numerous other admiring cadets, discussing the history of space swimming.

Min is left feeling miserable. She doesn't want to leave the ISS Corps, but she's also pretty sure that she won't be able to build her affordable and accessible space craft with the knowledge and skills from just one crew. She runs into ADI, who asks her about her upcoming decision. Min finds herself telling ADI everything, from her father's activism and her desire to be a "jack of all space trades" to her head tatoo pain and the discoveries she had been making about the pills. ADI looks strangely pleased, and confesses that he's impressed by how quickly she's been able to coordinate so many of her fellow cadets, from across different crews. He then casually hands Min a note, saying, "If you're still torn about your choice by midnight tonight...they might be able to help."

Min waits to go to the toilet before looking at the note, which contains a cryptic message. Min spends the rest of the day decoding it, in the end recruiting Asoka and Rhee to help her. It's a location, and a passcode. Rhee thinks it's a bad idea, maybe a nasty prank, and doesn't want Min to go. Asoka insists that ADI would never be malicious, and besides she is terribly curious, and wants to go with Min to see what this is all about. Min decides she wants to at least know what sort of help is being offered, and decides to go. Rhee and Asoka insist on joining her, using IRI to camouflage their presence. Rhee also insists on assembling a makeshift chemical weapon, just in case.

When Min arrives at the secret location, she is greeted by two masked cadets, who coldly ask if she came alone. Min says yes, praying that they cannot detect Rhee and Asoka and IRI. The 2 masked cadets then scan her with POCKET SCANNERS and find Rhee, Asoka, and IRI. There is some confusion over the unexpected turn of events, as the situation turns into a standoff. Rhee uses her makeshift chem weapon, which reveals the masked cadets to be wearing some kind of personal protective force field. Asoka tries hand to hand combat but one of the masked cadets is able to subdue her with a sheathed sword. A mysterious ESYRUP DAEMON pools into existence out of the shadows to subdue IRI. The two masked cadets then turn on a SIGNAL SCRAMBLER BUBBLE and show Min the results of their POCKET UNIVERSAL SCANNERS: Min has a government tracer in her nervous system, one that harvests biomarker data from her strangely viable ESYRUP contamination and sends it to an untraceable location. Rhee, whose parents use similar, commercial scanners in their mortician work, confirms their diagnosis. The masked cadets tell Min that if she wants to stay at the ISS Corps, she needs to get the tracer removed. Min is appalled that her bio-data has been harvested for the last week without her permission, but she's scared - won't whoever put this in her come after her if they see that the tracer isn't sending sensible data anymore? Also, how could she trust masked strangers to perform this surgery on her? "Please," says one of the masked cadets, "trust us, you need to remove this tracer. It can collect stressful or suggestive mind states, save the parameters, and artificially re-trigger that mindset in you, even remotely."

Min is growing increasingly frightened, and the masked cadets increasingly frustrated. Finally, they come to a decision, and take off their masks - it's Jheri and Zalo. Jheri says, "Look, I'm the best at this kind of surgery, even if I'm not yet even a Journeyhume. Please let me take this tracer out of you." Min agrees, realising that she trusts these two deeply.

## Chapter 7

Jheri carefully and painstakingly removes the tracer from Min. After the surgery, Zalo meticulously disassmbles the tracer and pockets the components. Min asks, so can I stay at ISS Corps now? Zalo and Jheri remind her that she needs to pick a crew. Min, exhausted and at her wit's end after the day she just had, explodes into a rant about how they wouldn't have been able to find the tracer, figure out what it's doing, and remove it, if Min hadn't worked with members of each crew, synthesizing their various expertises and interests to collectively solve this problem. Min's Grandmother runs a successful gang back on Earth because she can coordinate a huge variety of personalities and skill sets. Min doesn't understand how the ISS Corps will be able to prepare humans to be a space-faring species if they cling to ancient traditions of secrecy and isolated specialization. Asoka and Rhee chime in with equally furious opinions, and Zalo and Jheri ask them, do you really believe in integrating knowledge across the home crews, even though it's technically illegal? Asoka points out that over the course of this evening adventure, both Zalo and Jheri have revealed home crew-specific craft secrets with them already, and why were the two of them running around the interstitial spaces of the GEMINI wearing masks and sharing crew secrets, especially when they are on different crews? Rhee suggests maybe the muskies should report Zalo and Jheri! But Min says no, no one will report anyone, but it's so obvious the benefits of sharing knowledge between the crews, so if Zalo and Jheri can't help Min then Min will ask ADI for help. Jheri and Zalo exchange a look again, then turn to the Min, Rhee, and Asoka and tell them, let's take down the SIGNAL SCRAMBLER BUBBLE and go for a walk.

Jheri and Zalo lead Min, Rhee, and Asoka through a maze of interstitial spaces on GEMINI to get to another secret room, where ADI, Tross, Oana, GIARMO, and a few others are gathered. Zalo reveals that these are members of a secret society here at the ISS Corps, who are trying to reverse engineer the formula for making living, self-replicating and evolving ESYRUP, and who have realised that they need skills and expertise from across the different home crews. They call themselves Vigilante Intergalactic Roustabout Scholars (VIRS).

The VIRS show Min, Rhee, and Asoka their results so far. Tross, Jheri, and Zalo have figured out how to enable INQBI to completely change shape and size, turning into an amorphous shadowy blob then reforming. Oana and GIARMO have started to grow plants that are spliced with ESYRUP.

The VIRS ask Min, Rhee, and Asoka to join them. VIRSs can be on any crew and are expected to study their craft well enough to bring that knowledge to the other VIRSs. Also, VIRSs are encouraged to reframe insights, which come from working in secret with fellow VIRSs, into the language and logic of their home crews, to improve the work and progress of each craft.

Min is ecstatic and immediately says yes. Asoka is also very keen, ever up for a good adventure, and how can she say no to a secret society?? Meanwhile Rhee cynically asks whether she has any choice (will you just kill me if I say no, now that I've seen all this?), but in the end she confesses an eagerness to untangle the fundamentals of ESYRUP.

Zalo and Jheri remind Min that it is now almost morning, and she must pick a home crew. Min smiles, no longer stressed about this decision. She says, "I choose..."

## Dream: The Promise (3 pages)

Min and Soka met each other as small children, and shared dreams of exploring space without World Government permission or oversight. When Min's mother Jina fell ill with a mysterious sickness, Soka's father João revealed that he had a World Government medical scanner, and it proved to be key to healing Jina. But because João brought a taboo item, something made by the Orbiters, into an Automata clan, he and his family were banished. When Min and Soka said goodbye, they promised that they would find each other at the ISE Corps, in 4 years time.
