## Dream 1: Nostalgia

### Page 1

"Once upon a time..."

"before the Orbiters lived in the sky,"

"before we hid underground to survive **THE BOILING**"

"we all lived together, on the Earth's surface."

"We could all breathe the air,"

"drink the water,"

"feel the sun."

"We were all... 

"FREE."

## Chapter 1

### Page 1

Backdrop: the glittery blackness of outer space, tempered by the light touch of the outermost layer of atmosphere. 

PA: "This is a World Government Shuttle Barge Service, departing from Recife Shuttle Launch Station and terminating at **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**. We are now arriving at **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**."

Small panel, upper left of the page: very close-up view of Min's closed eye. Her **SUBDERMAL SHIELD** is in stealth mode, mostly invisible except where it is pretending to be tendrils of hair cut into an elaborate shaved pattern; her clan tatoos, frozen in an imitation of an Earther **GANGIE**'s head tatoo. Just around her eye, we see shadows of her raw eSyrup tatoo flickering with hints of her dreams. 

PA: "You may unbuckle your safety harnesses at this time."

Another small panel, floating just to the right and a little below the first panel: The eyelid cracks open and we see part of a dark, deep brown eye flecked with gold. A tendril of hair floats across Min's forehead - there is no longer enough gravity to hold it down. 

PA: "Please exercise caution while moving about the **SHUTTLE**."

Two panels, the same size as the previous small panels, connected to each other and in the middle of the page: (on the left) Min's POV, looking down her belly at the harness buckle. (on the right) View from above Min's seat, as Min floats up above her seat, still half-asleep and holding her belly rather tenderly. The PA announcement is mirrored in scrolling text in many languages on the ceiling of the shuttle compartment. 

PA: "The **SHUTTLE** will dock at this station for 2 hours. Please collect all of your belongings before leaving the **SHUTTLE**."

### Page 2

Upper left panel shows the typical icon for toilet facilities - **NEED TO DESIGN A TOILET ICON OF 2119**. Next panel: Zoom out to see Min, now wearing a large pack, exit the toilet facilities and lean against the wall with the sign; she still looks a bit groggy and disoriented. Next panel: We see Min in profile as she leans her head back against the wall, looking as if she is gathering her strength. Next 3 panels: Same perspective as previous panel, 1) Min's eyes snap open, and, looking more focused and alert, 2) she goes horizontal and 3) pushes off from the wall. 

Large panel, takes up the rest of the page: We see that the toilets were actually part of a large cylindrical tunnel, with shops, restaurants, pubs, toilets, etc, all the way around the cylinder, and a crowded stream of people either swimming through the center (few) or holding onto moving rails that have been elevated inwards, away from the outer walls of the transit tunnel (many). A sign pointing in the direction that Min is moving reads **"THIS WAY TO LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION"**. 

### Page 3

Small panel: Min is swimming through the station along a "tunnel" created by the moving rails, which carve paths of high speed traffic around the station. She is enjoying flexing her muscles after the long ride from Recife. Min turns a corner and suddenly...

Large half page spread: ...comes upon a section of the tunnel with a large viewing port. Earth gleams below like a greasy, grubby marble in the spotlight. 

Small panels: We see Min swim down to press her face and hands against the viewing port, view from the space side of the viewing port. 

Next panel zooms in on her eyes, which are reflecting the Earth below and surrounded by shadowy eSyrup tatoos going wild, barely able to keep themselves invisible. 

#### Flashback 

All of the following panels are in a single row along the bottom of the page. 

Similar view as the last non-flashback view, except now Min's clan tatoos, rather fewer in density, dance freely about her face, and she has no subdermal shield. Her eyes, on a visibly younger face, are wide with fear and full of confused tears. It is night, and the scene flickers with fire light. 

Magou: "We will take NOTHING from the Orbiters."

View from the floor: we see a long corridor within a large eSyrup bubble, and Min's legs as she hides in the shadows of an eSyrup tapestry, one of many fabrics draped to serve as dividing walls. The tapestry embroidery depict various rituals of the Automata. 

Amadou: "So you let your BLIND HATRED for ORBITERS kill Jina? And who will win, if we lose our clan's greatest mathematician??" 

View from the other side of the tapestry that Min is hiding behind: We see half of her face, cautiously peeking around the fabric, as the flickering shadows of Amadou, Min's father, and Magou, Min's grandmother, darken the tapestry. 

Small panel in the bottom right corner, the sharp, sparking, wrinkled eyes of Magou: "I said NOTHING!!" 

### Page 4

#### Flashback continued

Tall panel, angle of view is opposite from where young Min stands, so that we see the scene and Min hiding in the background: Magou, hands serenely on her crossed knees, her back rigid and tall with cold, sad, despair, and her face turned away from Amadou, who on his hands and knees is at face level with the much shorter Magou. Amadou's fists grip the floor rugs, his face, turned down, is streaked with tears, and his broad shoulders are bent with exhaustion. 

Magou: "Always trying to PUSH the boundaries of our traditions. We are the Automata! We are Free! We do not beg for scraps from the ones who abandoned us to die on the surface!"

The following small panels take up diagonal rows that cover the right half of the page, leaving the left half of the page for the previous tall panel. 

Row 1:  

Small panel, zoomed in on Amadou, eyes closed as if to pray for patience.

Small panel, Amadou's now open eyes: "You're right. We took in João and his family at my urging..." 

Small panel, Min listening from her hiding place, fascinated, to Amadou: "But even you were thrilled to learn that others had made it back to the surface..."

Row 2:

Small panel, focused on Amadou's fists: "And they have been so generous with their knowledge..."

Small panel, we see Magou, her hands no longer so serene as they tighten on her knees. Off-panel, Amadou continues: "Then your daughter fell ill, and nothing we do helps. So when they confess to the possession of an Orbiter device, ONE WHICH COULD SAVE JINA'S LIFE..."

Small panel, back on Amadou's fiercely determined eyes: "we punish them, for what? Keeping it a secret from us?"

3 small square panels, lining the top of the page: 1) Magou squints her eyes and grits her teeth against tears of frustration; 2) Magou lowers her head, hiding her eyes, her mouth set in sad determination; 3) zoom in closer on the same image from previous panel as Magou whispers: "FINE. Use the Orbiter device. If Jina dies, João **MORIERA** and his family also die."

Larger panel that spans full width of page. Magou points her finger imperiously as we see Amadou steely-eyed yet still incredulous, and over his shoulder, Min's eyes as wide as saucers from behind the tapestry. Magou: "If Jina heals, they will have 7 days to leave our clan and never contact us again."

### Page 5

#### Back on the **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**

Three small square panels in a row that spans the width of the page: We see Min's ear, with just barely visible shadows of her eSyrup tatoos writhing, as a warning siren of station emergency medical services wails in the distance. As we see Min's eyes turn from the viewing port to check for the source of the sound, she gets bumped hard enough to knock her head into the viewing port.

Large panel spanning the width of the page: Min turns to see an emergency medical team (EMT) and their floater (vehicle) moving painstakingly slowly in the center of the nearest set of moving rails, as people swim out of the way and crowd her view.

On the other side of the EMT and their vehicle, Min catches sight of a tall teen, gangly limbs fully covered in the traditional multi-layers of the BIOSILICA cult, swimming gleefully and deftly in all corners of the low-gravity **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**. The teen holds a large cup of drink in one hand, straw disappearing into the folds of their face mask, while gracefully using the other to push off a wall there, grab a pipe to turn a corner there. A cuttlefish mechapet floats nearby and holds on for dear life, with amorphous arms clinging to the teen's neck, shoulders, and head. We hear a distant mechanical "Wheeeeeeeeee!"

Tall rectangular panel: View of Min, from below, as she stares up at the tall BIOSILICA teen with slight dumbfoundedness, one hand still on the viewing port. In the viewing port behind Min we see the reflection of the BIOSILICA teen take a corner a little too fast and tumble into a dense crowd of people moving towards their own destinations via the moving rails.

Tall rectangular panel: The BIOSILICA teen is now being told off by some disgruntled older Orbiters. The teen holds their drink half like a shield, half in supplication, while the front of their face mask rearranges to say "Sorry!"  

2 wide panels, full width of page: The disgruntled older Orbiters begin to disperse. The BIOSILICA teen swims away while looking over their shoulder with "Sorry!" still on their face mask. The cuttlefish mechapet swims backwards while bowing and chirping: "So sorry, so sorry, have a nice day!"

Bottom of the page: Min stares after the BIOSILICA teen, then looks around the station with new eyes. She pushes off from the tunnel wall, not even looking at the paths demarked by the moving rails. 

### Page 6

Min is perched on the support beams, made of eSyrup-infused metal, munching on a small lumpy apple as she looks down at the platform for the ISE Corps Shuttle. The entrance to the platform is guarded by World Government Security Wardens, who are scanning everyone entering the platform for illegal substances and unregistered eSyrup products. 

Series of small panels show zoomed-in view of Min eating the apple from the bottom, meticulously spitting the seeds into a cloth in her hand as she consumes everything except the stem. 

Transition to flashback: In one panel, we see the World Government Security Wardens and their scanners reflected in Min's eye...

#### Flashback

...in the next panel, we see Min's eye reflecting a view from the bottom of the Recife World Government Shuttle Barge Service Station, grubby metal piercing the sky above the easternmost tip of the South American continent. The position of the sun says it's midday; the sky is smeared with grey-green-yellow light. 

Zoom out to see Min looking up still, while the Earther **GANGIE** she just bribed is still tucking away the plastic bottle caps used as currency in the underground cities. They are standing near a tunnel entrance with a door that has been disguised to blend in with the surrounding, strange flora.  

### Page 7

We see the top of Min's pack in a crowded marketplace. There are rock walls everywhere; we are deep underground. Artifical light streams from the fabrics that cover and divide the market stalls, casting a strange, multi-source glow that softens most shadows. Min walks up to the back of a market stall covered in fabrics screen-printed with World Government propoganda advertising work on Orbital construction projects as exciting, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. A small stick is tied on a long string at about head height on the fabric. Min takes the stick and scratches it against the fabric in a  casual pattern. A flap in the fabric slowly cuts itself to create a opening big enough to let Min inside. 

Earther **GANGIE** trader: "Did you bring it?" 

View is from inside, fabric on this side exuding dimmer light, the flap still open to the outside. Min reveals a pouch heavy with small lumpy objects, the size of large grapes. A beefy hand reaches for the pouch, but Min tucks it back into her jacket. 

Close-up on Min: "And you?"

View, showing us further into the back of the market stall, of a hand presenting a table with a small vial of purple, strangely dark liquid. 

Min: "I'll need to scan it."

Earther **GANGIE** trader: "Of course."

### Page 8

Min stretches a palm toward the vial, and on her palm her eSyrup tatoos reshape into a QR code. The eSyrup tatoos then exude light in the QR code pattern, making it 3-D. The 3-D QR code made of precisely controlled rays of light now envelope the vial, and the light flickers and hums. The 3-D photon QR code sings out a gentle "ba-DOOP!" and the light rays envolping the vial turn green. Min smiles with satisfaction. 

Earther **GANGIE** trader: "Happy?"

In response, Min tosses over the heavy pouch. 

The Earther **GANGIE** pulls out an [Ungurahua](https://youtu.be/baWFekERwsw) fruit, which looks like a rather large and plump, dark purple-black grape. The **GANGIE** activates a mouth mod and gives the raw fruit a good bite, to taste the fruit and feel the texture of the flesh. He grins with satisfaction.  

### Page 9 

#### back to the **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**

The apple is done. Close-up view as Min folds up the cloth with the seeds and stem. We get an "exploded view" diagram of the contents of Min's pack: 
* large sack full of mostly small, lumpy apples, but also carefully wrapped fruits native to the Amazon jungle basin.
* a set of eSyrup metal tools, like a multi-tool but it can actually morph, so it's much lighter and sleeker.
* several eSyrup bandanas and wash cloths
* an eSyrup toothbrush, which works like electric toothbrushes of 2018 but don't need to be charged, because metal eSyrup products are generally solar powered, sometimes thermal powered. 
* lightweight eSyrup habitat bubble, which is like a tent but made out of eSyrup fabric. 
* a tiny eSyrup thermal bubble, which is like a tiny portable oven; it can stretch up to 10 times its packed volume.
* the folded pouch full of apple seeds and stems
* the vial of purple liquid, now slightly less full than we saw it before

Zoomed out view as Min pushes off the wall and lands softly in the crowd milling about in front of the platform gate. We see her cheerfully walk up to the Wardens and the scanners. 

We see Min give the Wardens a charming smile as she hands over the World Government certified, encrypted eSyrup chip that serves as her temporary student ID. One Warden places the chip in the appropriate mod port and gestures to activate view mode. Min's Universal Record, hilariously sparse, appears around the Warden. We see *Guild Assignment: Unassigned* flashing in a corner.

A Warden uses their scanner mods to scan Min's pack, while another Warden scans Min's body. Series of small panels showing x-ray-like views of the contents of Min's pack as the World Government scanners see them:
* large sack of World Government standard issue food ration cans
* a metal standard issue mess kit
* an adorably small swiss army knife
* several small towels, folded
* a large blanket, folded
* the folded pouch full of standard issue toiletry items

Dialogue over these panels --

Warden: "Headed to the ISE Corps?"

Min: "Yes."

Warden: "This your first time in orbit?"

Min: "Yes!"

Warden: "So how you liking it?"

Min, with a laugh: "It's pretty different!"

Warden: "How you gonna survive school with just some apples and a blanket? Didn't you bring any clothes with you?"

Min: "Oh, I like the ones I'm wearing just fine."

Warden: "Huh. You're like my daughter, she got her first eSyrup suit and didn't change clothes for nearly a year, just morphed it! Sait it was the most convenient thing..."

Min: "They really are comfortable." 

Warden: "I told her she was doing too many morphs, she'd run out faster than the cloth would wear, and whttaya know, about 6 months in, the suit just stopped changing. Didn't even flicker when Alli ran the entile left wall of our home pod through it." 

Min: "Oh wow! Well, maybe an entire station will help me get past that hump."

Warden: "Haha! That's the spirit. Well you have a good semester young lady."

Min: "Thank you!"

### Page 10

Min boards the shuttle and gasps - the walls and floor are covered in organic material, hardwood and brick, textile and ceramic. She reverently places her hands on the hardwood wall paneling.

An announcement over the PA: "This is the ISE Space Shuttle to Gemini, headquarters of the ISE Corps. You must carry a valid student ID in order to use this shuttle. Otherwise, you may be charged a penalty fare, or asked to leave. We will be calling at ... **NAME SOME OTHER STATIONS HERE**"

We see the wood under Min's hand start to change into a living tree, as Min falls into another remembrance. 

PA: "We will be departing in 10 minutes."

#### Flashback

Bonfires on a warm night. Shadows of well-choreographed ritual dancers, powerful and strong from a lifetime of training, hover warmly, protectively. The view is zoomed out so that we see Min from above. Min is topless, sitting inside a large, fat metal hoop, a la Cyr Wheel. She is surrounded in many concentric circles of family and friends, all dressed in their most splendid clothing made of cloth infused with one of the AUTOMATA's original, surviving eSyrup cultures, called "Mothers". Everyone in the concentric circles are holding hands and focused on Min, their bodies convulsing in synchronised group ritual dance. 

Drum beats keep everyone synchronised. 

**"Another Tree Surfer is born tonight."**

Over this backdrop, small close-up panels are scattered, showing different parts of 16 year old Min, a year before she leaves Earth, large swaths of skin covered in proudly displayed, ecstatically dancing clan tatoos:   
* an eye, nose, and ear. The eye, of Korean - West African - Brazilian descent, is determined, steely, and dilated with adrenaline and euphoria. The nose and ear are pierced with eSyrup metal, formed into plain, elegantly raw shapes with rounded edges. The brow is set and only slightly sweaty. The head is shaved and covered in tatoos of her achievements as a clan member and Arborist. 
* a strong and straight back, dominated by an eSyrup tatoo depicting a shallow coral ocean scene, ever-changing.  
* shoulder and neck from the front, collar bone straight in a relaxed line that is perfectly parallel to the bottom edge of the panel. Neck is a bit clenched, and tendrils of Min's back tatoo curl around from her back in comforting, fractal patterns.  
* legs, covered in line art encoding her family lineage, are folded in an easy lotus, covered in the soft folds of ritual clothing appropriate for the ascent of a Journeyhume Arborist to the status of Expert Crafter: Tree Surfer. 

**"To be reborn, each Expert Crafter of the Automata must accept a MOTHER into their FULL SKIN."**

### Page 11

#### Flashback continued 

3 panels show close-up views of the people in the inner most circle, just on the outside of the metal hoop:  
* Jina and Amadou, also covered in clan tatoos and splendid eSyrup ritual clothing. Jina's subdermal shield, marking her as an Expert Crafter, dance triumphantly in shadowy patterns under the clan tatoos. Next to her is a tall, beautiful eSyrup metal bucket, holding ritual clensing water.    
* Magou, matriarch leader of their clan, subdermal shield barely visible beneath the many clan tatoos. She is proud, stern, and exhuberant on this day of achievement by her granddaughter.  
* **MARABA**, Min's cousin and dearest childhood companion, now an Expert Crafter: **INKER** and chosen for the honour of injecting Min's subdermal shield. Next to **MARABA**, in a shallow curving basket woven from eSyrup kevlar, is an enormous syringe full of swirling, bubbling, raw eSyrup, freshly harvested from one of their original, surviving cultures, called "Mothers". 

Wide panel, full width: **"DOOOOHM!"** The drums all come to a halt, and all of the concentric circles except the innermost lean in sharply on that last booming beat, hands all stretched towards Min, fingers shaking. 

Jina, Amadou, Magou, and **MARABA** all stand up and pick up the metal hoop. They hold it in place as Min steps onto the curving metal, hands pushing against the hoop above her head. Then they strap Min's ankles and wrists to the metal hoop. 

**MARABA** picks up the syringe as Jina picks up the bucket of water, leaving Magou and Amadou to hold the hoop with Min inside steady. 

Jina pours the bucket of water slowly over Min until Min is drenched, then returns the bucket to its precies, previous location in the circle. Then **MARABA** positions the needle of the syringe full of raw eSyrup against Min's right buttcheek, breaks the skin, and slowly injects all of the eSyrup as Min grits her teeth. 

Min's cousin pulls out the syringe and places it back on the basket. Then Jina, Amadou, Magou, and **MARABA** turn Min in slow circles as the raw eSyrup spreads throughout her body, spreading up her torso, across her arms and legs, over her face, into her eyelids and nose and mouth. As the subdermal shield continues down her throat to line her lungs and gut, Min begins to cough and gag. 

### Page 12

#### Flashback continued

Min's body convulses as her inner circle sets her upright in the very center again. The crowd chants "Be Free! Be FREE! BE FREE!" as Min finishes integrating the subdermal shield. After a tense moment, Min focuses her subdermal awareness to sprout razor sharp spikes at her wrists and ankles, cutting her bonds. The crowd roars with triumph. 

View from above: Min is on her knees, curled into a fetal position, cradling her bleeding wrists and ankles while her back tatoo writhes in distress. Jina, Amadou, and Magou gently place the hoop back down in its exact previous position, centering Min again. 

Magou stands at her original position in the inner circle and shouts: "Minka Oosou, daughter of Jina and Amadou, Tree Surfer of the Automata!"

View of Min from the front, gasping, blinking away large beads of sweat from her eyes as she looks up at her grandmother and clan leader.  

Magou's eyes, proud, confident, expectant: "WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE FREE?"

Min closes her eyes, tries to calm her breathing, struggling to stand: "To drink without bleeding, to breathe without choking, to see the sky and greet the day in my own skin..."

Min throws her head up and cries: "...and to MOVE in any direction with curiosity and grace..."

Zoom in on Min's mouth, exhausted yet serene, wry, and just a tiny bit cheeky: "...even OFF THE PLANET!"

## Chapter 2

### Page 1

We're back on the ISE Space Shuttle to Gemini Station. Min is now sitting in the cafe compartment, nursing a hot tea. She stares out the window as the curvature of the Earth slowly rotates under the shuttle. 

PA: "This is **THE MAE JEMISON MEMORIAL** station. Change here for **MAKE UP SOME ROUTES AND STUFF**. The next station is **SOMETHING SOMETHING**. This shuttle terminates at Gemini Station." 

Behind Min, who is well-hidden behind her large pack in her corner booth by the viewing port, a crowd of mostly Orbiters have gathered in small groups throughout the cafe compartment. The Orbiters have thin legs, very large puffy heads, and wear full-body eSyrup leotards, which act as an exoskeleton to help support their posture and compensate for the bone loss they experience, growing up and living their lives in space. Their faces are naked, and many of them already have World Government standard issue mods in their necks for space masks. 

The Orbiters all throw sidelong glances at a small group of Earthers, whose bulkier bodies were clearly developed under the influence of stronger gravity. But they also look different from Min - their backs are hunched from living their lives in underground tunnels, their skin is ghostly pale, and all of them have also been surgically equipped with World Government standard issue eSyrup body modifications, which stretch their pale skin paper thin and cast dark bruise-like shadows. Some of the Earthers, mostly from military or academia families, also find room to be disdainful and superior towards the **GANGIE** Earthers, identifiable by their elaborate head tatoos, who tend to be from the lowest castes in the great underground World Government cities. 

PA: "Please exercise caution while moving about the shuttle."

A distant commotion by the bar. An Earther **GANGIE** teen, with a body covered in mods and cautious, defensive eyes, has apparently knocked over the drink of a petite Orbiter girl and got her drink all over her. 

Petite Orbiter girl: "Wha--! Well excuse you!"

Earther **GANGIE**: "What? You were standing in the middle of the path."

Petite Orbiter: "What path, we're standing at the bar!"

During this scene, the panels are focused on Min, who is watching with bored eyes from over her hot cup of tea.

The Orbiter and Earther **GANGIE** continue to bicker in the background, as we see Min turn back to the viewing port. Behind her, a body dressed in the multi-layered clothing of the BIOSILICA cult appear. The body places the softest of finger-tip touch onto Min's back and whispers: *"Mini?"*

We can see Min's eyes, reflected in the viewing port, grow wide as the reflection shows a vague figure. 

Zoom in on Min's mouth, curved up in a triumphant grin: *"You made it!!!"*

### Page 2

Our attention shifts to the fight happening at the bar. Earther **GANGIE** reaches over to a not-quite cleared table to grab a mostly unused napkin while simultaneously grabbing Petite Orbiter's hand and starts to mop up the spilled drink on her hand: "Look, I'm really so--"

Petite Orbiter yanks her hand away and says coldly: "Don't touch me." 

Earther **GANGIE**: "What, I'm trying to--"

Petite Orbiter: "THAT'S NOT CLEAN, DON'T TOUCH ME WITH IT!!" This moment draws everyone's attention in the cafe.

Some other Orbiters come over and push the Earther **GANGIE** away: "Hey why don't you leave her alone?" "Just stop!" "Leave, Muskie!" 

Earther **GANGIE** gets immediately wild-eyed and says, soft and deadly: "You guys wanna fight?!"

As some of Earther **GANGIE**'s friends perk their ears and start to turn towards the scene, Petite Orbiter cries: "What?? No!"

Earther **GANGIE** presses a small grey canister into a body mod port on his neck, and his legs suddenly puff up, get more defined, his arms also get more buff, and an already sturdy-looking human is now pumped up like a body builder: "Fight me!!"

With a roar, several other Orbiters and Earther **GANGIES** press similar canisters into their necks, suddenly pump up, and throw themselves at each other. 

Everyone else looks on in serene befuddlement, and we see that even Min and the BIOSILICA teen can't help but stare. 

Petite Orbiter has also pressed a capsule into the mod port at her neck in an attempt to stay safe in a suddenly escalated situation, but her transformation isn't going smoothly. Her body wobbles and inflates in a rather chaotic manner for a few seconds, then everything deflates and the Petite Orbiter heaves an enormous vomit. People around her scatter away as fast as they can, knocking over more drinks. As she stumbles to get away from the fight, she turns and runs into the tall BIOSILICA teen. Min is on her feet by now.

Min to Petite Orbiter: "Are you alright?"

Petite Orbiter looks up at Min, pained and desperate, as the BIOSILICA teen steadies her. Then the Petite Orbiter heaves another vomit. 

### Page 3

The original Earther **GANGIE** who knocked Petite Orbiter's drink has finally noticed where Petite Orbiter ended up, and shouts: "Hey!" Min looks up to see him rushing over, intent on fighting Petite Orbiter. Min tries to warn the BIOSILICA teen and the Petite Orbiter: "Watch out--!"

But the Earther **GANGIE** is blind with chemically-amplified fury and approaching too fast. Min steps in front of BIOSILICA teen and Petite Orbiter to grab his punching arm and throws his weight over her hip. He crashes into the cafe booth. 

Min, furious: "Can't you see she's sick?" In the background, BIOSILICA teen is completely holding up Petite Orbiter. 

Earther **GANGIE**: "Why do you care?! Whose crew are you on anyway??" He runs a wild eye judgmentally over Min as he tries struggles to stand. His upper lip curls in a cruel smirk: "A mod virgin??" 

Min's brow furrows at the derogatory term. Earther **GANGIE** says, off-panel: "No wonder you're useless!"

Tendril-like arms of a mechapet cuttlefish deftly twist out the grey capsule at Earther **GANGIE**'s neck with a soft *"KWUSSSSSSHHHHH"*. Earther **GANGIE**: "What the--!"

An inky, blobulous cuttlefish mechapet, floating behind the Earther **GANGIE**'s head, swallows the grey capsule with a happy gurgle. While munching the mechapet happily explains: "I love **WHAMO!**!"

Without the WHAMO! capsule, the Earther **GANGIE** deflates quickly, and starts to shiver; furiously: "That's not fair you **FRACKIN** robot!" Meanwhile, mecha-cleaners have rushed over and start sucking up Petite Orbiter's vomit. She looks almost ill again, watching the cleaning robots seemingly slurp up her vomit, so BIOSILICA teen, their traditional religious eSyrup clothing glowing with the "data-shivers" from Iri's consumption of the WHAMO! capsules, now easily turns Rhee away.

PA, frantic, as other Orbiters and Earther **GANGIES** continue to brawl: "Will passengers please note that physical violence will not be tolerated on this shuttle service! Will passengers please note that physical viole--"

The PA interrupts itself with a familiar ding: "We are now approaching **SOMETHING SOMETHING**. Exit here for the ISE Space Orchestra Conservatory."

### Page 4

#### In a quieter compartment of the shuttle...

We see Min's hand with Petite Orbiter's capsule, holding it out as she says: "Here, eat this too."

Mecha-tentacles snag the capsule and bring it back to a delighted cuttlefish mechapet. 

Petite Orbiter, seated, is digging frantically through her bag as BIOSILICA teen holds the bag for her. Petite Orbiter finally produces an anti-nausea pill, then her face falls as she looks around and mumbles, "**FRACK** I have no water..."

Min cheekily produces 3 hilariously tiny bottles of water in one hand and a stack of fresh napkins with a grin: "Fizzy water nicked from the cafe?" 

Wide panel: the 3 teens, sitting side-by-side in the shuttle seats. Petite Orbiter sits in the middle, anti-nausea pill packaging crumpled in one hand, head tilted back as she guzzles the fizzy water clenched in her other hand, eyes closed, breathing hard. Min holds the stack of napkins while looking out the viewing port in this compartment, legs crossed in her seat and looking rather pleased with herself. The BIOSILICA teen sits with legs folded on top of their seat, cuttlefish mechapet happily munching the rest of Petite Orbiter's capsule as BIOSILICA teen pats it on the head. BIOSILICA teen's clothing once again pulse with glowing patterns, betraying a wireless coupling between the mechapet's internal state and the eSyrup in the BIOSILICA teen's clothing. 

Petite Orbiter finishes the fizzy water and collapses into the shuttle seat. Still looking up at the ceiling, she says a bit begrudgingly: "Thanks. Taking WHAMO! was a terrible idea..."

Min, handing Petite Orbiter the stack of fresh napkins: "Is that what's in those capsules?"

Petite Orbiter nods and wipes her face: "Have you never seen anyone using uppers before? I guess you are a mod vir-- I mean, you don't have an body mods..." 

Min's shakes her head while looking down: "You know, your friends kinda suck. None of them stopped fighting to even check on you."

Rhee's hands tighten in angry fists as she sneers: "Those ANIMALS aren't my friends. All they want is the next trendy mod and whatever psycho-stims they can get their rich, privileged hands on. I don't know ANYBODY here."

### Page 5

Min looks at Rhee for a second, then smiles and says: "Well now you know me. I'm Minka Oosou, Tree Surfer of the Automata."

Rhee gives a loud sniff, cleans her tears and blows her nose with the remaining napkins, then sits up tall: "I'm Rhee of the **SEPPELLITORI** guild, Vela quadrant. Thank you for helping me." Innocently curious sidelong glance: "Which gang is the Automata? I don't recognize your head tatoo..."

Min: "How would you know what **GANGIE** head tatoos look like?"

Rhee looks sad and guilty and looks down again: "My parents are morticians for several large space construction companies, and they usually hire **GANGIES** as cheap labor...so I've seen lots of head tatoos..."

Min, suddenly angry and proud and surprising herself with the fire in her voice: "That's why the Automata take nothing from Orbiters! We work for ourselves, and live free on the surface!"

Rhee looks surprised: "There are humans living on the planet's surface?" Eyes widen. "That's why I've heard the term Automata...I remember hearing how the World Government discovered a hidden civilization of nomadic humans on the surface, who somehow survived the Water Crisis and were living outside the law...that's you!"

Min, appeased but a bit embarrassed to have been part of someone's childhood stories: "Yeah, but...it's not...as glamorous as it sounds..."

Rhee: "Oh, yeah probably not..."

### Page 6

The cuttlefish mechapet belches, breaking the awkward silence. Min and Rhee stare, then they both start to laugh. 

Rhee, looking at BIOSILICA teen while reaching a hand towards the mechapet: "May I?"

BIOSILICA teen nods as the mechapet eagerly stretches out its arms to Rhee: "I'm Iri, I like you!"

After a moment of scratches and head pats, Rhee draws her head back from petting Iri and tilts her head curiously at the BIOSILICA teen.

Rhee: "I've heard of people who dress like you, and have mechapet companions...are you a follower of the Biosilica religion?"

BIOSILICA teen nods their head silently as the front of their mask spells out, "Yes." 

Rhee: "I heard that Biosilicans only use their voices for religious rituals and with members of their family...is that true?"

BIOSILICA teen nods again. 

Rhee: "So are there any deaf Biosilicans?"

BIOSILICA teen's mask rearranges to spell, "Of course!"

Rhee: "Then how...?"

Iri, giggling: "You have more senses than your eyes and ears!"

The BIOSILICA teen extends a hand palm forward to Rhee, a ghost of a smile visible beneath the teen's face mask. After a moment of confusion, Rhee puts her palm against the BIOSILICA teen's hand, who presses against Rhee's hand as Rhee suddenly looks as if she's being lightly electrocuted.

Rhee: "Aaah! ...oh wow, that was weird!" Rhee stares at her hand.

Then Rhee looks up at the BIOSILICA teen with a grin: "Pleased to meet you, Asoka of Green Haven Hibernia!" Iri claps two of its arms in celebration and looks enormously pleased. 

### Page 7

PA: "We are now approaching Gemini Station, home of the International Space Exploration Corps. This will be the final stop of this shuttle service."

Min to Rhee: "You alright then?"

Rhee: "I'm fine now. Thanks again, both of you."

Min stands and says: "If we're almost there I guess I should get my stuff out of the shuttle luggage lockers...do you know where we go when we dock?"

Rhee frowns: "Did you not get a message from your guild?"

Min shakes her head: "I'm Unassigned. Do you have a guild already?"

Rhee: "Yeah, I'll be studying with the **MENDELEEVERS**." To Soka: "You?"

Soka's face mask reads, "**CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE**".

Rhee, turning back to Min: "Huh, 'Unassigned' is new..."

PA: "We are now arriving at Gemini Station. This is the final stop of this shuttle service. All change ple--"

All three teens look up as the pre-recorded announcement is interrupted by a live announcement: "This is an announcement for all first-year trainees. Welcome to the ISE Corps! Please check your temporary student ID for your guild assignment, and follow signs to the appropriate docking bay door."

Zoom in on the scrolling text on the ceiling as the live announcement continues: "If you are Unassigned, please report to docking bay door 0813. Once again, if you are Unassigned, please report to docking bay door 0813." 

### Page 8

Zoomed out, bird's eye view of the Gemini Station receiving platform. Hundreds of new students, mostly Orbiters, stream out of the shuttle with their luggage, some in small groups of friends. About 30 docking bay doors lining the receiving platform are labeled with the names and crests of various guilds.

We zoom in on Min, carrying a large eSyrup-fabric pack on her back, stuffed to the brim. 

We see a sign: *"DOCKING BAY DOORS 0800 - 0820"*

Min peers around docking bay door 0813 and sees a small gathering of other Unassigned students. On a raised platform at the opposite end as the docking bay door, two older Orbiter teens wearing the guild crests that mark them as 3rd year trainees (Zalo and Jheri) stand looking over the group. The other Unassigned students are mostly Earther **GANGIES**, including the one that was in a fight with Rhee earlier; some Earther **NORMIES**; and 2 other BIOSILICA teens with mechapets, but neither are the BIOSILICA teen from earlier, and neither have a cuttlefish mechapet. 

Zalo: "Hello, welcome! You must be..." He consults the a diagram of faces and text floating beside him.

Zalo: "...Minka Oosou?"

Min has walked into the docking bay and puts down her pack with a grin: "Yup."

Zalo: "Great!" 

### Page 9

Close up on Jheri and Zalo: "Welcome everyone! I'm Jheri, 3rd year trainee of the **CYBERPHILIA** guild, and this is Zalo, 3rd year trainee of the **INFRADESTRUCTORS** guild. We are your Assignment Counselors, meaning we are here to help you get a guild assignment before the end of the week!" 

Jheri: "A guild assignment is a mutual pledge of respect, and a commitment to study the skills and protect the secrets of your guild. Usually, we would rely on the data in your Universal Record to assign you to the OPTIMAL guild, given your life choices and achievements. But since, for one reason or another," and here Jheri smiles kindly, gently looking each first-year in the eye, "your Universal Records have insufficient data to calculate the optimal placement, you will spend the first week of the semester browsing the guilds and taking some of their classes."

Jheri's eyes grow both sad and hard: "You'll need to impress the third year trainees if you want a recommendation to a guild. If you cannot find a guild to accept you and commit to teaching you their ways, there will be no room for you at this school, and you will have to go home."

The Earther **GANGIE** from the cafe fight: "But, wait, what if we're part of the Space Asylum Program? We have no home to go back to!"

Jheri looks terribly apologetic and says quietly: "If no guild will accept you, your scholarship will be void."

A wave of anxious whispers briefly rumbles through the gathered first-years: "But wait, then what about the bursary they promised my family?" "Wasn't last year's drop-out rate something insane, like 40%??" "Why can't we take a drop-out's assignment?" "You mean no one is obligated to teach us, even though we made it this far?" "Your recruitment material is deliberately misleading!"

The Earther **GANGIE** from the cafe fight: "So hold on, who put you in charge?"

Close-up on Jheri's eyes as she gives him a sharp look: "No one. We volunteered."

### Page 10

In the maybe-too-brightly lit Gemini mess hall. 

Rhee: "So you might have to leave??"

Min, staring in horrified fascination at the slop on her plate: "Eh, probably not. I have a whole week to make friends. I can be pretty charming." Min lifts a utensil-full of slop and watches it slowly **"PLOPP"** back onto the tray. 

Soka shoves their tray away in disgust. Their face mask swirls and solidifies into: "I can't eat this anymore." Iri begins to gleefully consume the slop, and starts to send "data-shivers" to Soka. 

Min: "Yeah, is this seriously the only option for food?" Slightly zoomed out view shows us the rest of the mess hall, most people eating mess hall slop. A few lucky ones have fancier food in front of them. 

Rhee, miserable: "You can get private catering, but it's really pricey." 

Min, to Soka: "Can I get a chem readout from Iri?" Soka hold up their palm and Min presses her palm into theirs. Min looks serene for a moment as her subdermal shield translates the vibrational information from Soka's glove.

Rhee slams her head down on the table. "I may never find out which guild you make, Min." Min looks over questioningly, munching on a mouthful of the dinner slop - she's decided that it won't kill her to eat it. 

Rhee, still face down: "I'll starve before the end of the week." Min swallows her mouthful, making an unpleasant but determined face, as Soka covers their mouth in horror. 

Min: "In that case, I'm not visiting **MENDELEEVERS** guild until the end of the week, just to force you to survive."

Rhee: "What? Nooo, don't do that..."

Soka's face mask reads: "When will you visit me?"

Min: "Also towards the end of the week. I wanna visit Zalo and Jheri's guilds first."

Rhee: "The Assignment Counselors? Why?"

Min: "They volunteered to spend time helping the Unassigned trainees."

Rhee: "So?"

Min: "Out of all the third-year trainees I've met so far, they seem the most likely to give an Unassigned Earther a chance. So maybe I'll like learning from them, and maybe they'll recommend me to their guild."

Soka nods as their face mask rearranges into: " 'Every teacher a monarch, every classroom a realm.' "

Rhee: "Huh?"

Min: "It's an old quote we both like. Basically, you can judge a good teacher the way you would judge a good leader -- honorable and respectful towards the people they lead, principled and thoughtful in their behaviour, willing to take risks and able to clean up afterwards." 

Min: "And depending on the risks they take, you can tell who and what that teacher believes in; in other words, the community they serve, the bounds of their kingdom." 

Min: "Zalo and Jheri are two Orbiters who believe in serving even Earthers and scholarship students. I wanna know where they get those beliefs."

### Page 11

We are now in a dimmer hallway of the Gemini Station, looking into a large open office space. The sign by the entrance says **"SERVICE CREW HEAD OFFICE"**. 

PQ: "Welcome, my intergalactic scholars!"

In the office, an Earther **GANGIE**, tall, glamorous crown of dreds piled up from a mohawk base and flowing down to her strong but not bulky shoulders, holds court. Her head tatoo is visible on the shaved parts of her head and continue down her neck onto her back. In the crowd of trainees before her stand Min, looking a bit queasy, the Earther **GANGIE** from the cafe fight, and several other Earther **NORMIES** and **GANGIES**. 

PQ, with a regal tilt of her head: "Adilette PQ, at your service. I'll be coordinating you with my full-time crew, so you come see me every week for your shifts, yeah?" The crowd of trainees nod.  

PQ: "So then, who's my Unassigned scholars?" Min and a few others raise their hands, including the Earther **GANGIE** from the cafe fight.

PQ: "Right, you lot will come see me EVERY DAY this week, ok?" The Unassigned trainees nod. 

PQ claps her hands. During the following speech we see Min 1) grimace and rub her sternum, 2) suddenly clutch her stomach, and 3) fall to the floor as her head tatoo throbs an angry reddish pink: "Excellent. The rest of you have weekly rotations which I've just posted to your Universal Record, and we'll keep to that schedule until mid-year holidays. Can everyone access their rota--!!"

Long thin line of static-filled darkness across the bottom of the page. 

### Page 12

Long panel, full width of page, Min's POV: slightly blurred vision of PQ holding a glass of water up to her face. In the background are medic guild trainees, checking Min's vitals with medical scanners. The other scholarship students peer into PQ's office from the hallway, some concerned, some curious. 

Next row, PQ looks back at a medic trainee and says: "I'm sure it's just a bad reaction to the station's low-G. I've seen this before."

Medic trainee: "Well all of your vitals are strong and steady. Get plenty of rest tonight, and drink lots of fluids, ok?"

View of Min, on the floor with PQ's jacket under her head. She nods. 

PQ: "Right then, thank you medics, for your swift response. I'll let this one have a bit o' quiet, then walk her back to her dorm." To the scholarship students: "Scholars! No more excitement tonight, off to bed!"

PQ closes her office door then makes a gesture that activates a strange energy in the room, making Min's hair stand on end. 

Min: "What's going on?"

PQ, eyes unfathomable: "I saw it...your subdermal shield."

Min clenches her teeth and begins to sweat: "How do you--??"

PQ smiles mysteriously: "I recognize it, because an Automata once saved my life with something similar. You wouldn't happen to know an old bird named Magou, would ya?" 

## Dream 2: The Night of a Thousand Burning Stars (3 pages)

PQ was part of a pioneering group of humans who were amongst the first generation to live in space. Most of these people were **GANGIES** with not many prospects on Earth, who were desperate for a change in their situation. But the first generation of space craft and orbiting structures had many bugs and kinks that still needed to be worked out. PQ was commuting in one of the Space Barges that exploded during the Night of a Thousand Burning Stars, when a domino effect of systems malfunctions caused several orbital construction sites to overheat. Everyone on board the Space Barge was wearing protective eSyrup suits, but these suits weren't designed to keep people alive while falling through the atmosphere. PQ was lucky and managed to survive the fall long enough to be discovered by a young Magou, who kept PQ alive by secretly giving PQ a partial injection of raw eSyrup. Magou then helps PQ return to the underground cities. 

## Chapter 3

### Page 1

It's the next day, first day of classes. We see a large hallway, with many tall double doors, each covered in the name and crest of a guild. One hand made banner above an entrance proudly labels the space as **"Workspace 267: INFRADESTRUCTORS"**. From inside, Zalo's voice can be heard saying: "...so if you gently peel back this layer..."

Next panel, we are inside the **INFRADESTRUCTORS** workspace, bird's eye view. We see Zalo standing at a large workbench surrounded by first-year trainees, including Min. Zalo is holding up a corkboard to which is pinned a flat, flexible device about the length and width of a short, fat finger. It has been carefully dissected so that the miniscule inner circuitry is visible. 

Zalo: "You can see how this 2080s standard issue medical scanner has two fixed eSyrup circuits - one for measuring small changes in skin resistance, the other for measuring small concentrations of specific chemicals in bodily fluid samples. Modern medical scanners can detect changes in electrical and chemical properties up to 5 cm below the skin surface."

POV is now in front of Zalo, who now holds up another corkboard on which is pinned a similarly shaped and sized device, also opened up. The insides of this second device is way more chaotic and rough, definitely looks like a work in progress. 

Zalo: "This is a prototype for a POCKET UNIVERSAL SCANNER..."

We see numerous panels showing close-ups of the workspace, with tools and materials typical of an electrical workshop, chemistry wet lab, plumbing equipment and tools, field biology equipment, etc. Over these panels, Zalo's voice continues: "...ideally, it can give electrical and chemical readings of other animal species, plants, objects, anything you could possibly want to scan!" 

Zalo: "So today's challenge is to debug this prototype, and learn how to morph eSyrup! Careful though, you only get 2 or 3 morphs out of these eSyrup chips, 4 if you're very lucky!"

### Page 2

View of the **INFRADESTRUCTORS** workspace, several hours later. Some trainees are still hunched over their devices, others have taken a break to sit in a comfortable circle of large cushions, rocking chairs, and sitting pillows. 

Min: "I didn't realise so many Orbiter products use semi-hardened eSyrup circuits! They're everywhere!"

Zalo, Min, and a few other **INFRADESTRUCTOR** trainees are seated together. Most of them have finished working and they are philosophising before dinner. 

An Earther **NORMIE** trainee, 2nd-year, named **DAMIEN**: "Yeah, it's kinda nice how modular everything can be, with stardardized parts..."

Zalo taps a tool on his leg distractedly: "Yes, but I just wish they weren't proprietary! It's a real pain in the ass to be tied to standard issue parts, which rarely have as many morphs as they claim they do." 

Sedii, Orbiter, 2nd-year trainee: "And if you want to do anything besides the exact function that those parts are designed for, you're screwed!"

**DAMIEN**: "So the semi-hardened circuits are good to prototype quickly, but if you want to make anything custom or complex, you'll need to do it the hard way anyway."

Zalo: "In theory, raw eSyrup can go through an infinite number of morphs, regardless of the material it's spliced with - what we lose in convenience and modularity, we gain in flexibility and expression!"

An Earther **GANGIE** and first-year trainee named **YOLENA**: "But then who will make sure that the mods are safe?" 

Zalo, looking meaningfully at the trainee: "Do you really think that every mod we have out now is perfectly safe?"

### Page 3

**DAMIEN**, shivers: "Ugh, definitely not! I've seen people have some CRAZY reactions to capsule stims..."

**YOLENA**, grim faced: "True. But THOSE are so dangerous because there's so much money in making chem mods, and the laws about honest labeling have no teeth. No one actually gets punished when their products melt the mod ports or poison you with bad filtering." 

Sedii: "And because the government forbits basic research into eSyrup, no one even knows enough what they're doing when they make the mods to be able to write accurate labels."

**DAMIEN**, bitter: "Yeah, the blind leading the blind..." 

Sedii: "Exactly! Isn't it CRAZY how eSyrup circuits seem to be a crucial part of all of our devices, our homes, our transportation systems, in fact, our entire space-faring infrastructure, and yet no one seems to know how the fundamental ingredient works?" 

Zalo: "I heard that before the Water Crisis, eSyrup was considered a cute biological engineering project, and the original inventors published the entire recipe for raw eSyrup ON THE INTERNET..."

**DAMIEN**: "Ha! Yeah, back when we thought the internet would exist forever..."

Min: "But, Zalo, are you trying to tell us that the **INFRADESTRUCTORS** guild ISN'T trying to research raw eSyrup? That's what I thought you meant by 'opening up all black boxes'..."

Zalo: "Ok, sure, but no guild is powerful enough to openly defy World Government law..."

### Page 4 

We're back in the mess hall. Today's standard issue rations are a rather vibrant shade of beet-maroon and tumeric-yellow. Min, Soka, and Rhee watch Iri shovel the slop into its mouth, then stare in morbid fascination at the sickly patterns made by the "data-shivers" sent to Soka's clothing. Min is poking and prodding the slop, while Rhee looks at Iri rather anxiously. 

Rhee: "Will the food hurt Iri? What do they put in this stuff anyway?"

Soka's face mask formulates the words: "Iri eats all kinds of stuff..."

Soka's face mask rearranges into: "...and nothing's broken Iri yet." Iri suddenly pauses in the middle of shoveling more slop into its mouth, wiggles it butt in momentary discomfort, then belches quite loudly. Rhee face-palms in humiliation, Min starts to snicker, and Soka slouches in their seat, shy about the attention Iri's belch has attracted. 

Rhee: "I can't eat any of 

Min, Rhee, and Asoka are at dinner again, looking glumly at today's unappetizing looking slop. Rhee is so freaked out by the food that she is refusing to eat any of it, and only nibbles at the sourdough bread made by her guild. Soka and Min are concerned and try to convince Rhee to eat something. Soka mentions that the **CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE** guild has fresh fruit, and Rhee immediately begs to have some. Iri offers to analyse the mess hall food and drink by consuming them and making digital analyses of them.

### Page 5 and 6

Min tells the other 2 about the incident in PQ's office last night, and how PQ covered for her, and how, turns out, PQ knows Min's grandmother. Min mentions how paranoid PQ was about government surveillance, and Rhee insists that they figure out something similar. Min and Asoka can communicate silently, via Min's eSyrup tatoos and Soka's eSyrup clothing, which can transfer information via modulated vibrations that seem to whisper words into the receiver's ears. 

#### Flashback

Min and Soka met each other as small children, when Soka's family was taken in by Min's clan. Soka's mom had tried to blow the whistle on a prominent agricultural engineering company, but she was betrayed and their family had to flee the government-funded agricultural research center where they lived. They weren't prepared to live beyond the safe bubbles of the World Government and would have died if Amadou hadn't found Soka and her family and brought them back to the Automata. Min and Soka became fast friends and shared dreams of exploring space without World Government permission or oversight. When Min's mother Jina fell ill with a mysterious sickness, Soka's father João revealed that he had a World Government medical scanner, and it proved to be key to healing Jina. But because João brought a taboo item, something made by the Orbiters, into an Automata clan, he and his family were banished. When Min and Soka said goodbye, they promised that they would find each other at the ISE Corps, in 4 years time. 

### Page 7

Min rushes down a corridor of the Gemini towards the Service Crew Head Office. From inside we hear PQ: "Next, Minka and Rajue!"

The Earther **GANGIE** from the shuttle cafe fight peels himself from off the wall and gives Min a murderous look as he walks through PQ's office door. Min smiles mildly, shrugs, and enters unenthusiastically behind him. 

Large panel, whole bottom half of the page: We see PQ standing next to a floating 3-dimensional schematic of the Gemini Station. The locations of all mecha-cleaner charging stations are highlighted and labeled. PQ is holding two heavy duty biohazard suits. PQ greets them with a "Good day my lovies! You alright, Min?" then says, cheerfully: "You two are servicing mecha-cleaners today!"

### Page 8

In a mecha-cleaner charging station, somewhere on the Gemini...

Min whistles from inside her biohazard suit while scraping hard-hardened, oozing, decomposing slime out of a mecha-cleaner's guts as Rajue hoses the mess down a drain in the center of the room. The epic hook of a currently trendy industrial metal band leaks softly from Rajue's ear mods and through his biohazard suit mask.  

Rajue, not looking at Min: "I've asked around. No one knows your head tats."

Min: "So?"

Rajue: "It leads me to 2 possible conclusions..."

Rajue: "Either your gang is so puny and unknown that it's not even worth beating the shit out of you..."

We see Min's face reflected in the grimy metal insides of the mecha-cleaner, anxiety well-contained but visible as Rajue continues: "...or your head tat's a fake!"

Min: "Oh yeah?" 

Min's face becomes unscrutable as she says, still cleaning the inside of the mecha-cleaner: "Well I've asked about YOUR head tats..."

Zoom in on Rajue's eyes, widening with anger and surprise as Min continues: "...and your gang was responsible for the **ARGO INCIDENT**, weren't you?"

### Page 9

Rajue, furious: "Who told you this?"

Min: "A mortician's daughter, from the Vela quadrant. She's a student here, same year as us." 

Rajue: "And do you ever wonder why WE service the mecha-cleaners, and not any of those big-headed, puny-legged Orbiters?"

Min shrugs, starting to sweat under the biohazard suit: "Because otherwise we couldn't afford the fees to train with space-faring guilds, duh."

Rajue: "And why are those fees so high, huh?"

Min, exasperated and suddenly feeling the same terrible burning and rushing feeling from her first night on board: "I dunno, because we're out in space maybe?! What's your point anyway?"

Zoom in on Rajue's frustrated and furious eyes, glaring at Min. Rajue: "My POINT is..." but he is interrupted as Min convulses in a seizure and collapses onto the mecha-cleaner she was just servicing. 

Rajue: "Auuugh!!"

### Page 10

Min is back in PQ's office. The **SIGNAL SCRAMBLE BUBBLE** is on, as PQ examines the black market injector and substance.

Min: "I'm SO LUCKY I was wearing the biohazard suit. Rajue is the LAST person who should see my subdermal shield."

PQ, holding up the substance in its vial up to the light: "Humph. Doesn't look any scarier than some of the chem mods that the Orbiter teens smuggle on board. And you say a **MENDELEEVER** is analysing the substance?"

Min: "Yes, well, at least, a **MENDELEEVER** TRAINEE is..." Min face-palms. "Actually, this particular trainee could use some help too...she's too freaked out by the food to eat it, we need a way to scan it in the mess hall or something."

### Page 11

PQ: "Hmm...I might be able to get my hands on a medical scanner, from the infirmary."

Min: "Isn't that incredibly risky?"

PQ: "What Magou did to save my life was far riskier. This is nothin, love. Besides, they're mandated to buy the new model at the end of each year. They have devices spilling out of their ears."

Min: "That reminds me...Rajue said something...INTERESTING...about the Space Asylum Program..."

### Page 12

Min and PQ discuss the Space Asylum Program and who it's actually serving. As Min leaves to go to bed, PQ warns Min to be very careful in the evenings, as that seems to be the time when Min has her most severe eSyrup reactions. 

## Dream 3: The Mole People (2 pages)

## Chapter 4

### Page 1

We see a surgery room labeled "Laser Atomic Manipulator. Wear eye protection at all times."

Rajue: "...how the hell is a mod virgin going to be of any use to the **CYBERPHILIA** guild??"

Min is in a class with the **CYBERPHILIA** guild. The walls of the surgery room are covered in anime fan art. In the center of the surgery room is a large, fluid device made of dark eSyrup metal. It is connected to a hermetically sealed glass chamber, large enough to fit a large human. Jheri is preparing to demonstrate to a group of first-year trainees, which include Rajue and a few other **GANGIES**, mostly Orbiters, and the two Biosilican Unassigned students. A **CYBERPHILIA** guild master oversees the class. 

**CYBERPHILIA** guild master: "Rajue! You will refrain from using such bigoted language!"

Guild master glares at Rajue and waits until he mumbles an apology.

Guild master: "Thank you. No space-faring guild can rely on the constant presence of World Government supply lines. You may one day find yourself without easy access to constant spare parts, and you may have to use your body UNMODIFIED. When was the last time you did that?" 

Rajue doesn't meet the teacher's gaze.

Guild master: "Jheri, please continue with the demo."

### Page 2

Jheri continues her prep for the demo. We see close-ups of different components of the machine, and different other tools/prep material scattered about the room as Jheri says: "The **CYBERPHILIA** guild specializes in the communication, control, and governance necessary for space exploration. This means that we need to study the psychology of not only individual agents, but also groups of agents, to understand how agents in a system influence and control each other."

As Jheri begins her demo, the Guild Master says: "This is the fundamental idea undelying the laser atomic manipulator. Through careful and subtle modulations of photonic energy, we've developed a language to negotiate with cells and tissues." 

### Page 3

Jheri is currently considered one of the top trainees at ISE Corps, in large part for her incredible dexterity and precision with the LAM. She has already begun her Journeyhume training with a Space University professor, who invented the most recent version of the LAM, which is an order of magnitude cheaper and more portable, and can cut out a 1cm cubed (as opposed to previous models' 5cm cubed) volume out from deep inside of a living animal without causing bleeding or needing stitches.

Guild Master turns to the first years with a stern look: "But before you even TOUCH a LAM, you'll need to prove your understanding of the theory." 

The Guild Master waves her hand in a well-practiced gesture and a wall of text and mathematical symbols appear in front of each trainee. "Memorize and drill these equations."

### Page 4

Min is exhausted with the combined effort of symbolic maths and careful hidden usage of her eSyrup tatoo. At dinner, Soka has smuggled several fruits in her multi-layered clothing for Rhee. Rhee has brought enough bread to share today, and desperately grateful for some variety to her diet, ravenously eats the fruit. 

### Page 5

They discuss what Min plans to do about the incident with her subdermal shield. Rhee has analyzed the black market injections that Min uses to render her eSyrup tatoos undetectable, by sneaking time on the **MENDELEEVERS** more sophisticated scanners and devices. She says that as far as she can tell, the substance is what it claims to be, and that it seems otherwise inert. But Rhee was rushed, and she's not super familiar with the scanners, so she's not super sure of her analysis. 

### Page 6

Min, via silent communication to Soka, who relays it to Rhee, mentions that PQ might be able to smuggle them a current model World Government medical scanner, so they can check the black market substance again. Soka suggests using the government medical scanner to scan all of the water and food also, since it might help Rhee eat something besides bread and fruit, and because they have no idea what could be causing Min's episodes. 

### Page 7

Min reports to Service Crew Head Office to PQ's office. She steps inside and closes the door, and PQ shows her the cutting edge, this year's model medical scanner that PQ has smuggled out of the Gemini infirmary. PQ mentions that these devices are all synchronised, so if Min doesn't want her scan to show up on the Universal Record she'll need to figure out how to disable the scanner's communication circuits. 

Min: "I know exactly who to ask."

### Page 8 

Next day. Full page depiction of the **CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE**'s main training gym, as guild trainees, most of them Earthers, do a physical warmup for partner acrobatics. We hear a steady stream of "Ready!"s, spoken by trainees with their hands raised, indicating that they are ready to base another trainee (this is the training sequence I saw at the beginning of Backbone show at Southbank Centre). Except for the first year trainees, all of the **CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE** trainees, including the Orbiters, are strong and muscled. Third year trainee **GIARMO**, a broad-shouldered Earther **GANGIE**, supervises the warmup. The ceiling of the gym is actually one wall of an enormous aquarium, full of old Earth animals and some new, genetically engineered marine animals. 

**GIARMO**: "Unassigned trainees! If you are an Orbiter, you may find the ways of this guild very difficult to follow."

The crowd of Unassigned trainees trying out this particular guild is indeed smaller and dominated by Earthers. 

**GIARMO**: "To be a space swimmer, you must keep yourself in peak physical condition. And life in space is the greatest enemy to human physical strength."

**GIARMO** rubs his hands together with gleeful anticipation: "So! Let's get started with stretches, then strength training!"

Montage of typical circus training exercises, especially partner acro stuff. 

Soka is strong but not the best at coordination. Min isn't so strong but incredibly dextrous and moves beautifully, artfully.

### Page 10

Whereas other guilds ate catered lunch from the mess hall, the **CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE** guild just puts out piles of raw fruit. 

**GIARMO**: "I hate to say it but the food they feed you is trash. We have a small orchard in one of the terrariums, these are much better for a mid-day meal. Besides, if you get too full you won't be able to use the playground." Soka and Min exchange a look, and they decide to eat only fruit from the orchards until they can sort out Min's eSyrup seizures. 

Large panel depicting an insanely creative playground, built by the guild trainees. Min sees the echoes of her beloved Earth trees in those playground structures, and is delighted to play on them, using Tree Surfer muscles that have been neglected ever since she came into space. 

### Page 11

**GIARMO** pulls aside Soka and Min to tell them that they show a lot of promise as space swimmers, and asks if they would be interested in a special group he's putting together to experiment with multi-partner synchronized space swimming, which could be a new way to accomplish certain build and maintenance tasks for space vessels in orbit or during space travel. Both Soka and Min are delighted. 

### Page 12

At dinner Min and Soka are so euphoric from the day that Min nearly forgets to find Zalo, but then she sees him right at the end of dinner. She runs after him and makes up a fake reason why he needs to come with her to the Service Crew Head Office, right now please. There, PQ shows Zalo the smuggled medical scanner. He freaks out and wants to take it apart immediately, but Min explains that she needs to shut off the scanner's communications and then use it to make an undocumented scan of all the food and water from the mess hall.

Zalo insists that he can build a food and water scanner from old parts, so Min has to explain the full story, about her subdermal shield and the eSyrup neutralizer substance. She shows him the substance and asks if he minds taking a look at it. Zalo's mind is blown when he learns that Min has raw eSyrup tatoos. He wants to learn more and help. 

## Chapter 5

### Page 1

ISE Corps alum Tross, a Biosilican, is visiting from Space University to give a demonstration of space welding tools as MENDELEEVERS trainees play rapid fire rounds of "What if...in space?!", in which a situation is invented in which something breaks out in space, and no internet is available, and very few technologically optimized tools are available, and thus one must macgyver a solution using un-networked tools.

Tross's mechapet, a midnight black, silky, sinewy cat named Inqbi, alternates between curling around Tross's shoulders like an adorable, purring scarf, to gliding through the shadows like a silent, hazel-eyed wave of death and destruction. 

### Page 2

Min finds Tross's teaching style incredibly exciting and asks such eager questions that Tross and Min continue chatting over lunch, where Rhee joins them. Tross, blushing slightly, pulls out a packed lunch, explaining that as an alum his meals at the mess hall aren't covered. Min assures him that he's not missing anything, as she uses some jam and cheese to spice up Rhee's bread. Min and Rhee become fast friends with Inqbi, who shares their fondness for fried cheese, which Tross has packed in copious amounts. Min's head tatoo has a small flare up again, luckily without any subdermal effects. 

### Page 3

Tross asks Min if she's alright. Min explains that she's having some bad reactions to zero-G, and she's thinking she might be allergic to something in the mess hall food. Tross confesses that he also never liked the mess hall food, and that while he was a student there was a group of students who expressed concern over some of the active ingredients in the mess hall food and tried to reform the mess hall's cooking methods. Tross gives Min a hard look and says, "If you can...don't eat the food here." Tross then excuses himself, saying that he needs to return to Space University now.

### Page 4

After lunch, Rhee introduces Min to Oana, another **NORMIE** and a scholarship student in her 2nd year, who has become an expert at blowing microscopic bio-compatible eSyrup-infused glass filaments, which can be gently embedded subdermally to create programmable, interactive "mod-makeup". It's not quite like eSyrup tatoos - the eSyrup in the glass filaments have only limited input from the biological tissue and are programmed prior to injection. 

### Page 5

Oana shows them how to verify each piece to certify it safe for subdermal injection. While they work, Rhee teases Min for her fascination with Tross. Oana reveals that Tross came to the ISE Corps during the same year as Zalo and Jheri, but he is the first and only cadet to graduate in one year - most students take the full 3, and occassionally someone graduates in 2 years. Tross is now a 2nd-year journeyhume at Space University as an independent space welder, but he returns to the ISE Corps for each year, to be part of the initiation week and hold workshops and demonstrations for the **MENDELEEVERS**. Min excuses herself to go to the toilet.

### Page 6

On her way back from the toilet, Min spies Inqbi disappearing around a corner. Min follows Inqbi in the hopes of running into Tross. Min finds herself in a workroom where she sees what looks like a delicate metal flower on the workbench. She goes in for a closer look. 

Tross suddenly appears and asks what Min is doing. He tries to encourage her to leave, but Min is fascinated by the flower and wants to learn more about it. Tross tells Min to forget the flower, claiming that it is a failed experiment that will get incinerated anyway. Min asks to take the flower, under the logic that she will happily investigate the "failed experiment", especially if no one else wants it. 

### Page 7

Tross refuses to give it to her and tries to physically remove her from the room, but of course Min doesn't stand for that. As their grappling becomes more earnest, one of the surveillance cameras catches the violence and an alarm goes off. Tross grips Min hard and says, deadly serious, "Min, if you value your life, leave right now." Utterly shaken, Min flees. 

### Page 8

Mess hall. Min finds Soka, Rhee, and Zalo, who says he needs to discuss something urgent. Soka asks why Min looks so shaken. Min brushes away Soka's concern and asks Zalo what he found. Soka hands everyone fruit from the **CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE** orchards, as Rhee passes around **MENDELEEVER** bread. 

Zalo insists on being careful about surveillance, so Min runs to ask PQ if they can come to her office. PQ tells Min to only bring people whom she trusts with her life.  

### Page 9

Min brings Soka, Rhee, and Zalo to PQ's office. Zalo shares his analysis of the eSyrup neutralizer, which seems inert, as Rhee initially concluded, but Zalo points out that some of the active ingredients are unusual choices given the supposed function. Given that, Zalo wants to take a blood sample from Min to run through the medical scanner. Min consents. 

As they watch the device spit out scan results, PQ wonders at what point Min stopped eating mess hall food. Rhee and Soka help Min remember, and PQ points out that ever since Min stopped eating mess hall food, her eSyrup seizures have stopped. Zalo also asks PQ if he can examine her **SIGNAL SCRAMBLER BUBBLE** device. Min assures PQ that Zalo is cool, so PQ let's Zalo tinker. 

### Page 10

Zalo wants to ask Jheri for her opinion on the blood analysis, with Min's permission of course. Min is exasperated that so many people are becoming privy to her subdermal shield and the true nature of her tatoos. Zalo looks Min hard in the eye and says that he trusts Jheri with his life. Min agrees to let Jheri look at the blood analysis, then PQ shoos everyone away so that Min can do her evening service crew shift. Before leaving Zalo begs to have one more look at the **SIGNAL SCRAMBLER BUBBLE**, so PQ reveals that she has a second one that Zalo can take, on the condition that if he gets caught with it, PQ will deny any knowledge or connection. 

### Page 11

PQ has put Min on paperwork duty in her office so that they can talk about Min's research into her eSyrup seizures. PQ seems unsurprised that the mess hall food is turning into the prime suspect, and apologises for not showing Min earlier. 

Min: "Show me what earlier?" 

PQ leads Min to a section of the Gemini that Min had never seen before - interstitial tunnels, where the service crew have been growing crops using re-directed waste water which they've filtered and cleaned using refurbished eSyrup products. Min is completely shocked, especially when she sees Rajue weeding one of the lines of crops. Min quickly moves out of his line of sight. 

PQ gives Min some of the food they grow, and Min can feel a huge difference in her gut.

### Page 12

PQ explains that this farming project started 3 years ago, after the first year of Space Asylum students started to fall ill and die from unexplained reasons. Since most of them are Earther **GANGIES**, PQ felt a need to take them all under her wing, and feed them food that reminded them of home food that might prevent them from wasting away with illness. Turns out that it saved the scholarship students' lives, and ever since PQ started the illegal farming project, no scholarship students have died. 

## Dream 4: A vision of Mother (1 page)

Min dreams of her mother Jina, her grandmother Magou, and all of the women who have been part of her lineage. She also dreams of the raw eSyrup culture in her skin, and its long life ever since it was born, way back before the Water Crisis. Min feels a strange pulsing in her body, it causes her pain and fear. 

## Chapter 6

### Page 1

Min wakes up in Soka's dorm room. She had snuck in last night because Tross's behaviour, Zalo's analysis, and PQ's reveal of the interstitial illegal farming had overwhelmed her, and she didn't want to be alone. She knows she should be checking out more guilds, but she finds the **CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE** daily routine so familiar and Asoka's presence so comforting that she decides to shadow Asoka all day. 

### Page 2

Min and Asoka work on space swimming drills until they reach lunch time, exhausted. Everyone is super excited by Min's immediate proficiency with space swimmer moves, and how strong and well trained her body already is thanks to working her whole life as an Arborist in giant trees. Everyone is also very impressed at how quickly Soka's space swimming is improving, especially with Min's help. 

### Page 3

Zalo and Jheri come to find Min and Soka during lunch. They bring the two first years to the **MENDELEEVERS** biomedical lab where they turn on the **SIGNAL SCRAMBLER BUBBLE** that Zalo got from PQ. They've analysed Min's blood, and extracted Iri's analyses of the food and drink. There are unusual substances in the school's food and water, and Min's blood sample showed that some of these substances may be able to assemble into neuro-data tracers. Given that, Zalo and Jheri have run analyses of their own blood, and found elevated levels of these unusual substances in their own blood as well. 

### Page 4 

Min: "So, wait...you're saying that someone is feeding us neuro tracers and then harvesting our data??"

Actually, according to Zalo and Jheri's analysis, someone made a brew that would react only with the components of a full subdermal shield. Someone is looking for Min, or someone with a subdermal shield, specifically. 

Jheri shares her suspicion that Min has already consumed enough mess hall food for the components to have assembled into a fully functional tracer. 

### Page 5

Min wants to know how they could find this tracer. Zalo says that his universal pocket scanner could pinpoint it, and potentially trace where the tracer was sending its data. But the universal scanner still needs some work, he's really struggling, even with Jheri's help. Min realises that Rhee and Oana could help, asks for the **SIGNAL SCRAMBLER BUBBLE**, and goes off to look for the two **MENDELEEVERS**. They all decide that the safest place to do this is PQ's office.

### Page 6

PQ's office.  Min, Soka, Rhee, Zalo, Jheri, Oana, and Iri are all gathered at the door as Min explains the situation to PQ and begs to use a safe space. PQ decides that the best place would be one of the interstitial rooms near the illegal farm. Also, turns out that PQ already knows Oana, as Oana has been working on the illegal farm since she arrived at the ISE Corps. 

### Page 7

Dinner time. Zalo, Jheri, Oana, Rhee, and Iri have been hacking away at the universal pocket scanner. Soka has brought back armfuls of fruit to help them stay energized. Finally, success! The universal pocket scanner is ready. 

### Page 8

Zalo and Jheri prep Min for the scan. After a few moments, everyone sees the results: Min has a government-grade tracer in her nervous system, one that harvests biomarker data from her subdermal shield and sends it to an untraceable location. This makes Min a huge liability, for the school and for herself. "It can collect stressful or suggestive mind states, save the parameters, and artificially re-trigger that mindset in you, even remotely." Everyone is horrified.

### Page 9

Min: "Jheri...how good are you at using the LAM?"

Jheri: "Pretty good, but I haven't done any surgeries on a living patient yet..."

Min: "Well, here's your chance. I'd like to be your first living patient."

Jheri is really stressed by this request. But Min insists, reminding them that she cannot practically stay at the ISE Corps with this in her body, and that they need evidence to prove that the food at the school is being used as a vector for sneaking government neuro-tracers into all of the students. 

### Page 10

Zalo and Jheri are surprised - Min wants to reveal everything? Min doesn't feel right, knowing that the students are being dosed with tracking substances and not doing anything about it. Rhee wholeheartedly agrees with Min that they need to expose the whole thing. Oana is quiet, watchful, listening carefully. 

### Page 11

Soka offers a middle ground: take out the tracer and research a neutralizer. It would be more difficult, but trying to blow the whistle on this whole endeavor might be tricky - it is a government tracer after all, which means that their enemy is the government. Soka knows first hand how impossible it can be to fight the government. 

### Page 12

Min is convinced by Soka's argument, as are Zalo and Oana. Rhee is unsatisfied, but willing to go with a more subtle path for now. Min now turns to Jheri, to convince Jheri to use the LAM on Min and extract the tracer. Jheri agrees. 

## Chapter 7

Jheri carefully and painstakingly removes the tracer from Min. After the surgery, Zalo meticulously disassmbles the tracer and pockets the components. The trainees look around and realise that it is quite late, and Min has completely missed her service crew shift. Zalo and Jheri also remind Min that she still needs to make her official submissions for guild membership, otherwise she won't be able to stay at the ISE Corps even after all of this effort to get rid of the tracer. 

Min, exhausted and at her wit's end after the day she just had, explodes into a rant about how they wouldn't have been able to find the tracer, figure out what it's doing, and remove it, if Min hadn't worked with members of each crew, synthesizing their various expertises and interests to collectively solve this problem. Min's Grandmother runs a successful gang back on Earth because she can coordinate a huge variety of personalities and skill sets. Min doesn't understand how the ISS Corps will be able to prepare humans to be a space-faring species if they cling to ancient traditions of secrecy and isolated specialization. Asoka and Rhee chime in with equally furious opinions, and Zalo and Jheri ask them, do you really believe in integrating knowledge across the home crews, even though it's technically illegal? Asoka points out that over the course of this evening adventure, both Zalo and Jheri have revealed home crew-specific craft secrets with them already, and why were the two of them such close collaborators, willing to share crew secrets, when they are on different crews?

Zalo and Jheri admit that they too are frustrated by the secrecy and possessive attitudes of the guilds. But what can they do? 

PQ interrupts and mentions that the illegal farm, and the **SIGNAL SCRAMBLER BUBBLE**, was developed by the scholarship students during their service crew shifts. These students had taken the knowledge and techniques of their guilds and had combined them to make these projects work. Oana reveals that these students are part of a secret society here at the ISE Corps, who are trying to reverse engineer the conditions for growing human-friendly crops, and who have realised that they need skills and expertise from across the different home crews. They call themselves Vigilante Intergalactic Roustabout Scholars (VIRS). Perhaps they can add researching the formula for making living, self-replicating and evolving eSyrup to their agenda. Would Min like to join them? Would PQ also accept Zalo, Jheri, Rhee, and Soka, who are not scholarship students, but have now gotten sucked into the workings of the secret society?

Min is ecstatic and immediately says yes. Asoka is also very keen, ever up for a good adventure, and how can she say no to a secret society?? Meanwhile Rhee cynically asks whether she has any choice (will you just kill me if I say no, now that I've seen all this?), but in the end she confesses an eagerness to untangle the fundamentals of ESYRUP. Zalo and Jheri also confess an eagerness to join the project, even though they will be graduating soon. 

Zalo and Jheri remind Min that it is now almost morning, and she must pick a home crew. Min smiles, no longer stressed about this decision. She says, "I choose..."
