"Once upon a time..."

"before the Orbiters lived in the sky,"

"before we hid underground to survive **THE BOILING**"

"we all lived together, on the Earth's surface."

"We could all breathe the air,"

"drink the water,"

"feel the sun."

"We were all... 

"FREE."

## Chapter 1

### Page 1

Backdrop: the glittery blackness of outer space. 

PA: "We are now arriving at **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**."

Small panel, upper left of the page: very close-up view of Min's closed eye. Her **SUBDERMAL SHIELD** is in stealth mode, mostly invisible except where it is pretending to be tendrils of hair cut into an elaborate shaved pattern; her clan tatoos, frozen in an imitation of an Earther **GANGIE**'s head tatoo. Just around her eye, we see shadows of her living e-syrup tatoo flickering with hints of her dreams. 

PA: "You may unbuckle your safety harnesses at this time."

Another small panel, floating just to the right and a little below the first panel: The eyelid cracks open and we see part of a dark, deep brown eye flecked with gold. A tendril of hair floats across Min's forehead - there is no longer enough gravity to hold it down. 

PA: "Please exercise caution while moving about the **SPACE BARGE**."

Two panels, the same size as the previous small panels, connected to each other and in the middle of the page: (on the left) Min's POV, looking down her belly at the harness buckle. (on the right) View from above Min's seat, as Min floats up above her seat, still half-asleep and holding her belly rather tenderly. 

PA: "The **SPACE BARGE** will dock at this station for 2 hours. Please collect all of your belongings before leaving the **BARGE**."

### Page 2

Upper left panel shows the typical icon for toilet facilities - **NEED TO DESIGN A TOILET ICON OF 2119**. Next panel: Zoom out to see Min, now wearing a large pack, exit the toilet facilities and lean against the wall with the sign; she still looks a bit groggy and disoriented. Next panel: We see Min in profile as she leans her head back against the wall, looking as if she is gathering her strength. Next 3 panels: Same perspective as previous panel, 1) Min's eyes snap open, and, looking more focused and alert, 2) she goes horizontal and 3) pushes off from the wall. 

Large panel, takes up the rest of the page: We see that the toilets were actually part of a large cylindrical tunnel, with shops, restaurants, pubs, toilets, etc, all the way around the cylinder, and a crowded stream of people either swimming through the center (few) or holding onto moving rails that have been elevated inwards, away from the outer walls of the transit tunnel (many). 

### Page 3

Small panel: Min is swimming through a station tunnel when she turns a corner and suddenly...

Large half page spread: ...comes upon a section of the tunnel with a large viewing port. Earth gleams below like a greasy, grubby marble in the spotlight. 

Small panels: We see Min swim down to press her face and hands against the viewing port, view from the space side of the viewing port. 

Next panel zooms in on her eyes, which are reflecting the Earth below and surrounded by shadowy e-syrup tatoos going wild, barely able to keep themselves invisible. 

#### Flashback 

All of the following panels are in a single row along the bottom of the page. 

Similar view as the last non-flashback view, except now Min's clan tatoos, rather fewer in density, dance freely about her face, and she has no subdermal shield. Her eyes, on a visibly younger face, are wide with fear and full of confused tears. It is night, and the scene flickers with fire light. 

Magou: "We will take NOTHING from the Orbiters."

View from the floor: we see a long corridor within a large e-syrup bubble, and Min's legs as she hides in the shadows of an e-syrup tapestry, one of many fabrics draped to serve as dividing walls. The tapestry embroidery depict various rituals of the AUTOMATA. 

Amadou: "So you let your BLIND HATRED for ORBITERS kill Jina? And who will win, if we lose our clan's greatest mathematician??" 

View from the other side of the tapestry that Min is hiding behind: We see half of her face, cautiously peeking around the fabric, as the flickering shadows of Amadou, Min's father, and Magou, Min's grandmother, darken the tapestry. 

Small panel in the bottom right corner, the sharp, sparking, wrinkled eyes of Magou: "I said NOTHING!!" 

### Page 4

#### Flashback continued

Tall panel, angle of view is opposite from where young Min stands, so that we see the scene and Min hiding in the background: Magou, hands serenely on her crossed knees, her back rigid and tall with cold, sad, despair, and her face turned away from Amadou, who on his hands and knees is at face level with the much shorter Magou. Amadou's fists grip the floor rugs, his face, turned down, is streaked with tears, and his broad shoulders are bent with exhaustion. 

Magou: "Always trying to PUSH the boundaries of our traditions. We are the Automata! We are Free! We do not beg for scraps from the ones who abandoned us to die on the surface!"

The following small panels take up diagonal rows that cover the right half of the page, leaving the left half of the page for the previous tall panel. 

Row 1:  

Small panel, zoomed in on Amadou, eyes closed as if to pray for patience.

Small panel, Amadou's now open eyes: "You're right. We took in João and his family at my urging..." 

Small panel, Min listening from her hiding place, fascinated, to Amadou: "But even you were thrilled to learn that others had made it up to the surface..."

Row 2:

Small panel, we see Magou, her hands no longer so serene as they tighten on her knees, as Amadou continues: "And they've always been so generous with their knowledge..."

Small panel, focused on Amadou's fists: "Then your daughter falls ill, and nothing we do helps. So when they confess to the possession of an Orbiter device, ONE WHICH COULD SAVE JINA'S LIFE..."

Small panel, back on Amadou's calm yet determined eyes: "we punish them, for what? Keeping it a secret from us?"

3 small square panels, lining the top of the page: 1) Magou squints her eyes and grits her teeth against tears of frustration; 2) Magou lowers her head, hiding her eyes, her mouth set in sad determination; 3) zoom in closer on the same image from previous panel as Magou whispers: *"FINE. Use the Orbiter device. If Jina dies, João **MORIERA** and his family will also die."*

Larger panel that spans full width of page. Magou points her finger imperiously as we see Amadou trying to hide his shocked reaction, and over his shoulder, Min's eyes as wide as saucers from behind the tapestry. Magou: "If Jina heals, they will have 7 days to leave our clan and never contact us again."

### Page 5

#### Back on the **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**

Three small square panels in a row that spans the width of the page: We see Min's ear, with just barely visible shadows of her e-syrup tatoos writhing, as a warning siren of station emergency medical services wails in the distance. As we see Min's eyes turn from the viewing port to check for the source of the sound, she gets bumped and a mechanical voice says "Whoops, sorry!"

Large panel spanning the width of the page: Min turns to see a tall teen, gangly limbs fully covered in the traditional multi-layers of the BIOSILICA cult, an cuttlefish mechapet floating by their head, body and arms curling around the human's shoulders. The teen holds a large cup of drink in both hands, straw disappearing into the folds of their face mask. The mechapet waves an arm and chirps again: "Sorry!" 

Tall rectangular panel: Min stares up at the taller BIOSILICA teen with slight dumbfoundedness, one hand still on the viewing port. In the viewing port behind Min we see the reflection of the BIOSILICA teen pressed in by a dense crowd of people trying to keep moving while leaving a path for the emergency medical services.

Tall rectangular panel: The BIOSILICA teen stares back at Min, then takes a loud slurp of drink through the straw. The wail of the emergency medical services passes behind the BIOSILICA teen. 

Long thin panel, full width of page: The crowd begins to disperse. The mechapet looks over the BIOSILICA teen's shoulder, then turns back to the humans and chirps: "Ok then, have a nice day!"

Bottom of the page: The BIOSILICA teen gives Min a friendly wave, then disappears into the crowd. Min stares after the BIOSILICA teen, then shakes herself out of her reverie. She pushes off from the tunnel wall, aiming to swim in the opposite direction. 

### Page 6 and 7

Min finds the platform for the school shuttle. The entrance to the platform is guarded by World Government Security Wardens, who are scanning everyone entering the platform for illegal substances and unregistered e-syrup products. 

#### Flashback

Min, on her way to the Space Barge station to leave Earth, stops by a black market drug dealer to buy a substance that when injected, will render her e-syrup tatoos undetectable by World Government standard issue scanners for 24 hours. Min has learned the circuitry of the Orbiter scanners herself, and uses it to verify the chemical components of the substance. But the dealer is acting shifty, and then tries to bargain for a higher price. Min gently but firmly insists on the original price. 

#### back to the **LOWER ESTATES ORBITAL STATION**

Min casually rubs the side of her neck, where we can see a tiny pinprick of an injection needle. She squares her shoulders and approaches the platform gate and the Wardens and the scanners. She shows them her documents proving that she is a scholarship student at the ISE Corps, and passes through without incident. 

### Page 8

Min boards the shuttle and gasps - the walls and floor are covered in organic material, hardwood and brick, textile and ceramic. She runs her hands along the material as she remembers living and working in the trees on Earth as a Tree Surfer.

An announcement over the PA: *"This is the ISE Space Shuttle to GEMINI, headquarters of the ISE Corps. You must carry a valid student ID in order to use this shuttle. Otherwise, you may be charged a penalty fare, or asked to leave."*

Min wanders the shuttle until she finds the cafe compartment. She gets a cup of hot tea and takes it to a seat next to another viewing port. 

Over the PA: *"This is the ISE Space Shuttle to GEMINI, headquarters of the ISE Corps. We will be departing in 10 minutes."*

As she sips her tea, she stares down at Earth and falls into another remembrance. 

### Page 9

#### Flashback

Bonfires on a warm night. Shadows of well-choreographed ritual dancers, powerful and strong from a lifetime of training, hover warmly, protectively. 

**"Another Tree Surfer is born tonight."**

Over this backdrop, small close-up panels are scattered, showing different parts of 16 year old Min, a year before she leaves Earth, large swaths of skin covered in proudly displayed, ecstatically dancing clan tatoos:   
* an eye, nose, and ear. The eye, of Korean - West African - Brazilian descent, is determined, steely, and dilated with adrenaline and euphoria. The nose and ear are pierced with e-syrup metal. The brow is set and only slightly sweaty. The head is shaved and covered in tatoos of her achievements as a clan member and Arborist. 
* a strong and straight back, dominated by an e-syrup tatoo depicting a shallow coral ocean scene, ever-changing.  
* shoulder and neck from the front, collar bone straight in a relaxed line that is perfectly parallel to the bottom edge of the panel. Neck is a bit clenched, and tendrils of Min's back tatoo curl around from her back in comforting, fractal patterns.  
* legs, covered in line art encoding her family lineage, are folded in an easy lotus, covered in the soft folds of ritual clothing appropriate for the ascent of a Journeyhume Arborist to the status of Expert Crafter: Tree Surfer. 

Bottom of the page, larger panel, full width of the page: the view zooms out so that we see Min from above. Min is topless, sitting inside a large, fat metal hoop, a la Cyr Wheel. She is surrounded in many concentric circles of family and friends, all dressed in their most splendid clothing made of cloth infused with one of the AUTOMATA's original, surviving e-syrup cultures, called "Mothers". Everyone in the concentric circles are holding hands and focused on Min, their bodies convulsing in synchronised group ritual dance. 

Drum beats keep everyone synchronised. 

### Page 10

#### Flashback continued 

3 panels show close-up views of the people in the inner most circle, just on the outside of the metal hoop:  
* Jina and Amadou, also covered in clan tatoos and splendid e-syrup ritual clothing. Jina's subdermal shield, marking her as an Expert Crafter, dance triumphantly in shadowy patterns under the clan tatoos. Next to her is a tall, beautiful e-syrup metal bucket, holding ritual clensing water.    
* Magou, matriarch leader of their clan, subdermal shield barely visible beneath the many clan tatoos. She is proud, stern, and exhuberant on this day of achievement by her granddaughter.  
* **MARABA**, Min's cousin and dearest childhood companion, now an Expert Crafter: **INKER** and chosen for the honour of injecting Min's subdermal shield. Next to **MARABA**, in a shallow curving basket woven from e-syrup kevlar, is an enormous syringe full of swirling, bubbling, living e-syrup culture, freshly harvested from one of their living Mothers. 

Wide panel, full width: **"DOOOOHM!"** The drums all come to a halt, and all of the concentric circles except the innermost lean in sharply on that last booming beat, hands all stretched towards Min, fingers shaking. 

Jina, Amadou, Magou, and **MARABA** all stand up and pick up the metal hoop. They hold it in place as Min steps onto the curving metal, hands pushing against the hoop above her head. Then they strap Min's ankles and wrists to the metal hoop. 

### Page 11

#### Flashback continued

**MARABA** picks up the syringe as Jina picks up the bucket of water, leaving Magou and Amadou to hold the hoop with Min inside steady. 

Jina pours the bucket of water slowly over Min until Min is drenched, then returns the bucket to its precies, previous location in the circle. Then **MARABA** positions the needle of the syringe full of living e-syrup against Min's right buttcheek, breaks the skin, and slowly injects all of the e-syrup as Min grits her teeth. 

Min's cousin pulls out the syringe and places it back on the basket. Then Jina, Amadou, Magou, and **MARABA** turn Min in slow circles as the living e-syrup spreads throughout her body, spreading up her torso, across her arms and legs, over her face, into her eyelids and nose and mouth. As the subdermal shield continues down her throat to line her lungs and gut, Min begins to cough and gag. 

Her body convulses as her inner circle turns her a few more times in the Cyr wheel, then they set her upright in the very center again. The crowd chants "Be Free! Be FREE! BE FREE!" as Min finishes integrating the subdermal shield. After a tense moment, Min focuses her subdermal awareness to sprout razor sharp spikes at her wrists and ankles, cutting her bonds. 

### Page 12

#### Flashback continued

View from above: Min is on her knees, curled into a fetal position, cradling her bleeding wrists and ankles while her back tatoo writhes in distress. Jina, Amadou, and Magou gently place the hoop back down in its exact previous position, centering Min again. 

Magou stands at her original position in the inner circle and shouts: "Minka Oosou, daughter of Jina and Amadou, Tree Surfer of the Automata!"

View of Min from the front, gasping, blinking away large beads of sweat from her eyes as she looks up at her grandmother and clan leader.  

Magou's eyes, powerful, expectant: "WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE FREE?"

Min closes her eyes and breathes deep: "To drink without bleeding, to breathe without choking, to see the sky and greet the day in my own skin..."

Min throws her head up and cries: "...and to MOVE in any direction with curiosity and grace..."

Zoom in on Min's mouth, serene and just a tiny bit cheeky: "...even OFF THE PLANET!"
