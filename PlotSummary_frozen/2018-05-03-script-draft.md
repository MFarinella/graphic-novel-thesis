## Prologue: 

*The great Colorado River is now but a forgotten memory. The lucrative farms in northern California, bread basket of [Cascadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_(independence_movement)), sucked it dry in 2092, ruining that year's crops and sparking riots.*

*[Not just North America,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Nations_of_North_America) but [the whole world, looks different now](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/03/where-do-borders-need-to-be-redrawn/a-post-colonial-africa-drawn-by-nature-and-culture).  HIV and AIDS have become a forgotten disease, one you get vaccinated for as a baby in any half-decent hospital. But a new disease ravages the poor and oppressed of both overcrowded cities and desolate rural areas: the **MIND WIPE DISEASE**, which causes [anterograde amnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia) and usually kills its victims through secondary causes, most commonly autoimmune disease and cardiovascular disease. Patient zero of **MIND WIPE DISEASE** occurred during the **GREAT WAR OF 2057**, but ever since then there's been major outbreaks every year. *

*Out of the ashes of the **GREAT WAR OF 2057**, The **GLOBAL SPACE CONSORTIUM** established the ISS Corps, their flagship educational project for teenagers, an international training program for youth interested in career class "Interplanetary Travel and Communications". The ISS Corps was meant to be a living promise, that nations could now put aside their cultural and historical grievances, and their children would grow up together.*

*The ISS Corps became popular amongst the wealthy and elite of the world, because graduates were often well recommended, personally, for Space University, the most prestigious university in the world. To maintain diversity of the student body, and as a savvy PR move in support of humanitarian efforts around the world, the ISS Corps decided to offer asylum to the families of any young climate change refugees willing to become a "scholarship student" at the ISS Corps. The scholarship meant that these students could attend the ISS Corps for free, and receive financial support for their university-level training of choice.*

*It also meant that they committed 5 years of their wage-earning years to the **GLOBAL SPACE CONSORTIUM**.*

## Chapter 1: CASCADIA

**Min is with her family in Vancouver General Hospital, where they have been living as refugees for nearly a year. They had to flee their home in Denver when an outbreak of MIND WIPE DISEASE caused mass hysteria and riots. While Min's mother is recovering in the hospital, she finds an advert about the ISS Corps. She urges Min to apply, who has been obsessed with space travel ever since she took a ride in a space shuttle as a small child.**

**Min is initially excited to hear about the GLOBAL SPACE CONSORTIUM'S offer to waive tuition to the ISS Corps, but she is reluctant to leave her family after the trauma of being driven out of their home. Min's parents don't like the conditions of the scholarship, but they also see very few other options for getting Min the certifications she needs in order to work in space travel. Her parents are also in a position with little options, as they lost everything when they fled Denver. The whole family has been relying completely on the generosity of Vancouver General Hospital for nearly a year, and they all agree that with this scholarship, they have a chance to regain their dignity and independence.**

**SPACE CONSORTIUM is concerned - some people are worried about letting large numbers of refugees into an elite training institute, where students have access to very advanced tech and many resources. Neural implants for behavioural control have been successfully deployed in prison systems, but the general public is still a bit squeemish about making these body modifications a common-place thing. However, behavioural modification via "social networks" is now a refined art, and "smartphones" have now become "haptic communication implants". Like a smartphone, these retinals can track your location, record audio or video without direct instruction from the wearer, track physiological measurements like heart rate and blood pressure, and is, naturally, connected to your internet self. Cruder, less sexy behavioural control implants are quite common for laborers, factory workers, and any other wage slaves, especially in work environments which are loud, busy, and require complex coordination in a chaotic environment - think like a beeper, but implanted into one's body. But also, these implants get used when factory overseers or managers/supervisors want to be able to deploy instructions remotely.**

**Anyway, forcing the WEST AMERICA refugees to all get neural mods would be frowned upon and quite expensive. Giving all of them retinals would also be expensive, but easier to pitch, and besides, the refugees would be an amazing source of neuroscientific data! So all refugees applying to be scholarship students are also told that if one gets admitted, they will be offered free retinal fittings.**

## Chapter 2: THE GREEN HAVENS, or YOU SAY YOU HAD A REVOLUTION

**A new generation of urban farmers, the PROTO-VIRS, living at the fringes of sprawling metropolitan areas have been taking over abandoned million-dollar apartments (another "convenient" price, just half the price of last year's Volkwagon e-Mini, perfect for your government mandated 2-children limited family! *plastic smile*) and turning them into permaculture research schools. Many of their children fell victim to the MIND WIPE DISEASE. Distrustful of the government's suggested treatments, which have shown terrible reliability, the PROTO-VIRS begin to conduct their own neuroscience research on their tragically damaged children. They learn that the MIND WIPE DISEASE is caused by an overdose of government mandated mood stabilizers and realise that they need to continue their independent neuroscience reserach, and in secret. The PROTO-VIRS begin to adopt orphans of climate change crises, and teach them how to score perfectly average and docile on all of the governments' tests, thus escaping any need for mood stabilizers. In time, the PROTO-VIRS's permaculture research schools were incorporated into the SPACE CONSORTIUM, and their "successful" aspects were harvested as inspiration for the structure of the ISS Corps.**

notes on the above: make this a story told by one character to another. maybe Min to Asoca? Or maybe a teacher?

**Asoca's mother Eithne was an orphan adopted by the PROTO-VIRS, trained in GREEN HAVEN IRELAND and stationed at GREEN HAVEN SHETLAND with her husband João, a permaculture farmer from Devon who grew up in a community of PROTO-VIRS children, even though he was not raised PROTO-VIRS himself. Eithne and João raise Asoca on an agricultural research station as loyal scientists in the eyes of the surveillance cameras of the SPACE CONSORTIUM, but via secret hand signals, they communicate and practice their PROTO-VIRS traditions. They hope for a humanity mature enough to treasure the biological heritage of the planet and live in true freedom, without slavery of any kind, even while training their bodies to meet violence and oppression without fear. Asoca's parents have played capoeira with her since she was a baby, looking to any curious government surveillance video curator like just a game played between parents and children, with singing and clapping and tumbling around. Asoca's parents noticed from a very early age that she seemed to just "get" the emotional landscape of a room or situation, and she was eerily good at befriending notoriously unfriendly people.**

note: maybe this whole thing is a story told by a VIRS, several generations later?

**Asoca is tired of the tiny village of GREEN HAVEN SHETLAND, where she has lived her whole life. Her parents have taught her about the PROTO-VIRS and the history behind their work, but she's not sure if she truly identifies as a PROTO-VIRS. In the last year, she's been helping her mother research plants useful for space travel, and she has many ideas about how to build better space architecture to facilitate keeping plants alive in space. She's also excited by the possibility of meeting other children raised by PROTO-VIRS, which her mother assures her is highly likely in the ISS Corps. Eithne reminds Asoca that if she wishes to join the PROTO-VIRS, she must declare her intentions to do so before graduating from the ISS Corps.**

## Chapter 3: HOW TO SURVIVE THE ISS CORPS

**ISS Corps is quite competitive -- less than 15% of applicants are accepted into the program. It also has a reputation for about 25% of the first-years dropping out because they can't handle some aspect of life in the ISS Corps, which is very socially intense and intellectually challenging. In addition, in order to come back for a 2nd or 3rd year, 1st year cadets must be recommended by their home crews.**

**3 years is the maximum length of time that a student may remain in the ISS Corps. After that, they are expected to have completed their apprenticeship certifications; some complete their certifications in 2 years, very rarely does anyone complete their certification in 1 year. Most ISS Corps graduates go on to attend Space University, which has now been relocated to its own geosynchronous space station. A significant minority stay with the ISS Corps to complete their 4-year vocational training, which can stand in place of a university degree but is much more specialised and not considered quite as prestigious.**

**During Asoca's induction week at the Kennedy Memorial Shuttle Launch and Maintenance Station ("the Kennedy Station"), built just south of the old ruins of the historic Kennedy Space Center, she completely resonates with the CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE's ethos and home structures. Her cheery attitude is endearing to most but annoying to some, especially Min, who is now a 2nd-year cadet on the CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE home crew. Min is now readily acknowledged as the best space swimmer currently studying at the ISS Corps, and she's beaten nearly every space swimming record the school holds. But in the last year, Min has realised the truth of the SPACE CONSORTIUM's "scholarship" -- she is expected to work part-time on the ISS Corps' service crews (janitorial, cafeteria, grounds keeping, waste & recycling, stores & mail) for every year of her apprenticeship. This only strengthens Min's resolve to be amongst the top 10 students in her graduating cohort (the top 10 receive fully paid fellowships for their university level training), so she studies and trains her space swimming skills with furious discipline. She is, by her own admission, "picky" about her collaborators, and not very extroverted; she prefers to watch the first-years from afar, and shows friendliness only in quieter moments. Min judges Asoca to be naive and privileged, unaware of life outside her own tiny bubble, until the home crew has a training session, and Min sees Asoca's more disciplined, martial side when Asoca plays capoeira. Min finds herself unable to stop watching Asoca, and is drawn to get to know her.**

## Chapter 4: THE CUTTLE SHUTTLE

**Min is one of many of cadets who share an appreciation (some might say obsession) with cephalopods. Last year the OCEAN SCIENCE CREW did an intensive observation study of freely-swimming cuttlefish in an environment where they can hunt "robotic prey" (Cuttle Shuttle), and they now want to analyze the video and figure out how to apply the movement stabilization that cuttlefish achieve during tentacle shots to human space swimming techniques and space module connection protocols.** 

**The OCEAN SCIENCE CREW consists of Min; her crew co-captain ZALO, from the INFRADESTRUCTORS crew, who helped build the environment and observation rig, in addition to helping program the robotic prey used to entice the cuttlefish into behaving; JOERRY, also of CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE, who knows how to raise cuttlefish in capitivity and is considered the local animal husbandry expert; TEHBAN, from the CYBERPHILIA crew, who works on the automated tracking and video dataset digestion; CEDDIT, also from the INFRADESTRUCTORS crew, who builds "movement translators" which map the cuttlefish movements to the human body in order to present a report on the cuttlefish research's applicability to improving space swimming techniques (HIVE TRACKER). RHEE of the MENDELEEVERS, another first-year cadet, also joins the OCEAN SCIENCE CREW. ADI, an ISS Corps professor on the teaching staff for "Health and Well-Being in Space", is their faculty mentor.**

**Asoca becomes interested in the Cuttle Shuttle project for its applications to space modules and space architecture, and joins the OCEAN SCIENCE CREW. As Asoca and Min work together, they have many conversations expressing their philosophies about teaching and society, and realise that they share some fundamental values, even though they have different plans of action deriving from those values. They realise that they both believe in the power of education and the necessity of subversion and critical thought in a society, but Asoca believes that a wise leader can best nurture these two cultural tools, and Min believes that individuals must maintain constant vigilance against leaders using these two cultural tools.** 

## Chapter 5: WHAT IS CLASS?

**As Asoca spends more time with Min, Asoca realises that Min works part-time on the service crews, in addition to everything else she does in order to be a top 10 student. She finds it unfair that Min is judged according to the same criteria as those students who are not required to dedicate half of their time to service crew duties. Asoca tries to convince Min and the other scholarship students to boycott their service crew duties, and the scholarship students reveal that the money they earn during their part-time work directly impacts the amount of financial aid given to their families. Asoca finds this exploitative, and tries to rally the other students to show solidarity with the scholarship students and demand better conditions for their scholarship. But most of the other students do not find the conditions of the scholarship so offensive, or they are unwilling to spend time on this instead of on their coursework and training, or they are so cynical that they don't think any good will come of speaking up about the terms of the scholarships. Even Min would rather "play the game well". Asoca also realises that there are no children of PROTO-VIRS amongst the scholarship students, even though some of the PROTO-VIRS children come from the same areas as some scholarship students.**

**Asoca also makes a strong connection with TROSS, a third-year journeyman at Space University who visits the Kennedy Station often to see his nephew CLAVEL, one of the MENDELEEVERS. TROSS is one of the engineers coordinating the most recent batch of renovations for the Kennedy Station and a teaching assistant at Space University who specialises in space welding. TROSS was a MENDELEEVER at ISS Corps and was primarily responsible for adding a forge to the MENDELEEVER workspaces. TROSS and Asoca bond over a shared passion for the inherent good of space exploration, even while being challenged by each other's methods of going about it: TROSS believes in prioritizing the strength and longevity of space structures through a reliance on technologically enhanced inorganic materials, while Asoca believes in prioritizing the strength and longevity of the space-faring people through a reliance on sustainable life cycles for material and psychological resources.**

## Chapter 6: SURPRISING MINDS

**A year has passed, and it is Min's final year with the ISS Corps. In order to complete their certification, youth cadets must spend at least one year conducting scientific research and at least one year building educational exhibits showcasing this research in the context of one of their required topics for apprenticeship certification. Asoca and Min now share a joint sleeping structure, and they have formed the INTERACTIVE EXHIBITS crew, with plans to use outdated and/or recycled space shuttle/station cameras and monitors, which are deployed by advertising companies to track the visual gaze of passers-by, to build educational exhibits teaching the general public about how our brains build, adjust, break, and re-build our "internal model of the world", a topic from one of their required courses, "Health and Well-being in Space" (SURPRISING MINDS). Others on the INTERACTIVE EXHIBITS are DARU, of the CYBERPHILIA crew; and CLAVEL, of the MENDELEEVERS. ZALO, who graduated in the top 10 last year and chose to stay with the ISS Corps for his university certification, is now a journeyman systems engineer and gets the INTERACTIVE EXHIBITS crew access to the outdated and recycled hardware that they need.**

## Chapter 7: DO YOU TRUST ME?

**Asoca hasn't told anyone besides Min yet, but she also plans to graduate this year. Asoca has realised that the "human brain == computer" analogy destoys our ability to build trust, in each other and in our own selves, because we become conditioned to believe that learning to how to trust can be reduced to a quantifiable optimization function. Together, Asoca and Min are realising that humans cannot advance as a super-organism until we re-learn how to build trust, and we regain our evolutionary ability to spread out to where there is room and resources for us instead of being stuck in increasingly over-crowded locations because we've forgotten how to survive without our infrastructures of convenience. During this final year, they share their dreams with each other. Asoca wants to liberate the PROTO-VIRS by building space farms, and creating green spaces for growing food and natural life cycles that are out of the reach of the SPACE CONSORTIUM and any haphazard overflow of the aggressive urbanization still ravaging the Earth. Min wants to make space travel accessible to anyone but especially the now impoverished and homeless refugees from WEST AMERICA. She feels that refugees can have a second chance by becoming space nomads, and building homes for themselves that are safe from climate change and ignorant politicians trying to standardize procedures for populations too large and diverse to be standardized. They promise to be strong in their goals, even though they must part ways: Asoca will go to Space University, while Min has chosen to stay with the ISS Corps.**
