# Chapter 1

*The DEATH DOGS don't come in the day. They come at night, after curfew, after everyone has taken their sleeping pills, unless their religion forbids it.*

*If your parents are rich, your NEUROMOD protects you, from DEATH DOGS, from bad water, from the swarms of robotic insects. You probably even ate some real plants at some point in your life.* 

*If you're most anyone else, you build your FORCE JACKET with as many sensors as you can handle and stay on your best behaviour out in public.* 

*If you're very lucky, and you are born to PROTO-VIRS parents, your FORCE JACKET is light as air, can change colours and textures to suit your moods, and is paired to a COMPANION MONSTER. The COMPANION MONSTER can clean bad water, emit ultra-sonic sounds to repel robotic insects, and die protecting you from DEATH DOGS.*
