### quick note 
VIRS "ships" are as much mental as physical. VIRS's can be part of many crews simultaneously. Balancing these many social contexts and roles is considered part of the art of a VIRS. 

# BIG ARC

## from the concept summary
The story needs to be about the architect and the engineer and about when they meet at the ISS corps. From the concept summary, need to flesh out these paragraphs: 

"The First VIRS (Minka) was the Architectâ€™s (Asoca's) best friend. They grew up together, and as teenagers they participated in a summer program for youth with the ISS corps, a government-run volunteer organization that provides support to the International Space Station and any shuttles traveling to and from the station. While working on the maintenance teams for the shuttles, the two friends learned a great deal about the cutting edge of space exploration technology, and saw that humanity was poised on the brink of great societal changes due to the imminent development of faster-than-light transportation and communication. The two friends realized that political power structures and the distribution of wealth would undergo incredible upheaval, and that within their lifetimes humanity would either cooperate to spread to the stars or squander our chance through greed, mismanagement, and short-sightedness.

One friend felt that if humans were to become a space-faring species, competent leaders with a unified vision needed to coordinate across global resources for developing space travel and communication. Otherwise, opportunities could be wasted in the face of political conflict or incompetence. While working for the ISS corps, she meets an urban planner who has been hired to plan renovations and expansions to the ISS. They bond over a shared passion for understanding and designing the infrastructure necessary for space exploration. After that fateful summer, this friend went on to study exo-architecture (designing and building space stations and colonies) and maintained close correspondence with her mentor as he renovated the ISS.

The other friend felt that if humans were to become a space-faring species, space travel needed to become easily accessible, and for that to happen, the knowledge, skills, and materials needed to go to space needed to be more widely available. She decided to stay with the ISS corps instead of going to university, apprenticing herself to anyone that would teach her. She eventually becomes close friends with one of the lead engineers over their shared passion for sustainability practices and the open access movement. This engineer teaches her how to build space-worthy craft and engages her in long discussions about the power of information for good and evil." 

## a couple details to think about
- Asoca and Minka knew each other from before the ISS corps summer youth program? How, if they grew up in such different environments? Maybe something like AICL, a summer camp that they went to together for years before deciding to go to ISS corps summer program instead, together. **Naw, let's not have them know each other before ISS corps, it makes much more sense for them to come from very different backgrounds and then meet at the ISS Corps summer program.**
- Asoca: Good with grand ideas and inspiring large groups of people, though very self-deprecating and more introverted than she presents. Very generous with friends and colleagues and often cheerful, but goes through bouts of cynicism when too many take advantage of her generosity and good nature. Enjoys the quiet and wild beauty of rural living but is drawn to cities and the sensation of being part of a super-organism. Mother is an herbalist who studies plants useful for space travel (exo-hydroponics). Father is a farmer specializing in permaculture. Grew up in a small rural community.
- Minka: Meticulous worker who prefers working alone because not enough people meet her standards for competence, but loves to coordinate ambitious projects with a small group of trusted collaborators. Picky about everything: food, her friends, and how she spends her time. Pessimistic about human systems but convinced that the destructive tendencies in human nature are the result of generations of indoctrination by a corporate oligarchy. Believes in the ideal role of education to free humans from oppressive systems and to empower humans to live in a society of true equals. Mother is a mathematician who worked on the ansible but retired to teach high school. Father is an artist activist who has been protesting the application of the ansible for secret government surveillance and military oppression. Grew up in the affluent part of a large urban area.
- bees are super important for space farms. how will space crops be pollinated?
- ISS Maintenance stations should be scattered across rural America. Is this feasible?

## How to fit my research projects into the plot
During the summer youth program, all "youth cadets" conduct a science exploration. Minka and Asoca choose to study cuttlefish hunting behaviour ([**Cuttle Shuttle**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/cuttlefish-hunting-behavior/)) in order to develop new space swimming techniques based on flexible scaling of the timing of movements ([**Movement control**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/movement-control-across-timescales/) and [**HIVE tracker**](https://hivetracker.github.io)), especially for rapid stabilization in zero-G environments. 

Youth cadets that excel during the summer program are invited to spend a 1-year apprenticeship with the ISS corps, during which they learn how to maintain the shuttles and present a project exploring the life cycle of resources used to build and maintain space shuttles. Minka and Asoca become apprentices and use outdated or recycled space shuttle cameras and monitors to build interactive exhibits that teach the public about the ISS corps mission and day-to-day activities ([**Surprising Minds**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/surprising-minds-brighton/)). 

During that year, Asoca meets Urban Planner and by the end of Asoca's apprenticeship they co-write a short manifesto on the "Social Responsibilities of the Intellectually Privileged, with an especial focus on those who build infrastructure" ([**Philosophy and Ethics**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/scientific-philosophy-ethics/)). Also during that year, Minka meets Lead Engineer and they both get very bad first impressions of each other. During the second half of the apprenticeship, all apprentices wishing to stay with the ISS corps instead of going to a university for baccalaureate certification are required to take courses on the ISS corps's Theories of Science and Engineering ([**Theoretical Puzzle Pieces**](http://www.danbeekim.org/brainplay/2018-02-02-theoretical-puzzle-pieces/)). Minka takes these courses and through the class discussions realizes that Lead Engineer shares some of her most fundamental values. 

## integrating my research with the VIRS setting

### open causal reactions versus closed loop perceptual control

One of my main focuses in the thesis is about comparing open causal to closed control. What if we imagined a world where open causal "won", and everything is super extremized for the philosophy of humans as open loop causal reactionary machines?

### notes from skype with Nuno
in the 60s there was tons of hype and excitement about space exploration, but people got tired of the hype and funding started to run dry. putting humans into space costs about 50 times more than doing the same thing with satellites. people stopped being excited about going to the moon after 2 or 3 times. 

during cold war, there was clear incentive for politicians to invest in space exploration. about 2% of national gdp was invested into space exploration. so first there's a war, arguably good because there was no casualties (little? not talked about?) and there was a huge jump in the technology. 

JFK's speech about going to the moon. 

once it became clear the russians won't be getting to the moon politicians lost their incentive, people got less impressed with going to the moon, so funding ran dry. after that, specific missions would sometimes get people excited and funding would come back up, but then enthusiasm would die again. the Space Shuttle program was one of these missions that got people really excited, but then it turned out that the space shuttle program was way more expensive than anticipated. also now there's a crazy amount of bureaucracy that you have to go through. for instance, if you're developing a new technology for rockets, whatever you build won't be launched for at least 10 years. also now that there are much fewer missions, each mission has a lot of pressure to succeed as much as possible. for each project you do a risk assessment, which basically puts everything on a table saying here's something that can go wrong, how bad would it be for this to go wrong, then you calculate it, and then you decide, well it's too risky. 

NEW SPACE AGE: commercial space endeavors

in this age, you care less about risk. as a company, the only people you're responsible to is your board members (and your customers, but insurance can take care of any risks in that direction). The people spearheading this endeavor are as crazy as those in the 60s without needing a war. also the technology development in the electronics world was so big in the 90s, so now commercial space endeavors can take advantage of this to develop things more cheaply and more easily. 

Elon Musk: I'm willing to risk much more to get to a specific milestone, and then once we reach that milestone, we'll be making profit. 

He had 4 missions where he needed at least one of them to succeed in order to prove that he could do this. failed 3 and succeeded 1. 

Dragon capsule, carries people. 

We aren't using a system too different from the 60s, more like the individual components are updated to be digital, touch screens, etc instead of crt monitors and buttons. there have been incremental developments but new theoretical frameworks are still coming. 

people want minimum amount of maintenance on the space shuttles -- it should be about the same amount of work done to maintain airplanes. Visually check external components, refill some fluids, then it's ready to fly the next day. so actually people are trying to merge development of airplanes and shuttles to balance risk and cost and to learn from each other. 

but these commercial endeavors probably won't end up really doing research, because at the end of every year they need to show profit to investors, so it's hard to think long-term. they will develop new tech that can be considered profitable. everything that is science and research related should be done by the ISS Corps as a government run initiative. also NASA pays to SpaceX to launch research vessels. 

NASA is currently developing a huge launcher (**S**pace **L**aunch **S**ystem) this will be the one taking you to Mars. also SpaceX is developing the BFR (big fucking rocket). 

THOUGHTS ON GROUP ORGANIZATION AND LEADERSHIP: BENEVOLENT DICTATORSHIP VS. DISTRIBUTED DECISION-MAKING

Apollo teams. Formula 1 crews have 2 heads. check out sectors where you really need efficiency and you really need things to work. Surgeons in the OR. some combination of the two options is the best, where everyone is contributing to the decisions but for each project or goal there is a "captain", someone who calls the shots. this cuts down on bureacracy and unnecessary meetings :P

OTHER THOUGHTS

research for space exploration often comes back to society in different ways. the space exploration provides a need, "I need to do these integrals to get a more awesome rocket" or whatever, to develop more conceptual things. internet, freeze drying, etc. 

What if Elon Musk showed up a little earlier?

investment structures now are completely different than they were in the 80s and 90s. before the end of the 90s the tech was also not quite ready. to have governments provide funding instead of investors, there would need to be a series of well connected points where the public interest in space exploration stays so strong that the people demand that politicians continue funding space exploration. 

also in terms of the technological advance, it takes time for people to accept new tech into the fabric of society, to the point where we are comfortable with it enough to risk sending it into space. 

Al Gore space art, Earth marble. 

What if some super insightful person showed up and pitched the ISS Corps as an educational, world uniting endeavor? what if there's a way that human society got trained for cooperation, not brutal competition? think about how society trusts scientists so much, but the way scientists are trained to communicate and publish is totally fucked up. 

# MOAR RESEARCH MATERIAL

https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/planetes

space debris: it's a problem because everytime you have a collision you exponentially increase the number of particles, then those particles will collide with something else and it takes a while for this debris to fall to earth and incinerate in the atmosphere, in the  meanwhile as it slows down enough to fall it's colliding and creating more debris. space agencies keep a huge catalog of all of the known debris. what would it take to clean the debris? difficult part is getting to the same speed in the same direction as the debris. 

International Space University: Nuno made a proposal for space refuel system to refuel satellites, by taking propellant from the moon and launching it to orbit then from orbit refueling everything. Right now we use propellant to send propellant to satellites with thrusters. 

but how to pay for this? should it be based on how many satellites a country has in orbit? should it be based on who causes accidents?

don't forget that you also need propellant to slow down and de-orbit. 

MARS: http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/mars/

news: China has a space station, they lost control of it two years ago and it just landed back on Earth. all they could do was wait. 

MIR: russian space station that also lost control and crashed to earth. "de-orbited" in 2001. 

you want to launch to the East to use the rotation of the Earth to help you gain speed. this is why the US launches from the east coast, so that if it falls on ascent it falls into the Atlantic Ocean. 

# PLOT SUMMARY

## background
Asoca and Minka met each other at a summer camp for creative learning. Asoca had been going to this summer camp since she was 8. Minka didn't start coming to this camp until she was 11, at a time when Asoca was 13. Min and Soca, as they were called, became fast friends during the 4 weeks of their first summer together. 

This summer camp however was meant for children year 3 through year 12, so when Soca was 17 and Min was 15, it was Soca's last year at this summer camp. Min could technically come for another year (though she's 2 years younger, because she skipped a grade she's only one year behind Soca in school), she was really sad about coming back without Soca. 

During the year after Soca's last summer camp, they learned about the ISS corps summer youth program. It is for 15-18 year olds, regardless of their school year, as long as they haven't started a baccalaureate program of study (undergraduate degree) yet. Soca and Min both apply and are offered spots in the youth program. They decide to go during the last summer before Soca goes to university. 

## plot vomit
When Min and Soca arrive, they are assigned sleeping quarters based on their ages (Min with the 15 year olds, Soca with the 17 year olds). They learn that during the day, they will spend their time in work teams and on science exploration teams. 

### work teams
Everyone in the summer youth program is part of a rotation that eventually has them on a work team with every other teenager in the youth program. The work teams also rotate in such a way that everyone gets exposure to every role and responsibility at the shuttle maintenance station, and everyone gets the chance to go up to the ISS in a shuttle and experience the roles of maintenance and shuttle construction up on the station. 

NEED TO PICK SOMEONE'S BRAINS ABOUT DAILY LIFE ON THE ISS, AS PART OF A NASA CREW, ETC. 

Work teams: 
- research and development
- ground conrol
- flight planning and logistics

### science exploration teams
With at least one other person, everyone must work on and present a project that explores an aspect of living and working in space. Or, everyone must do a project involving the [Spacelab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacelab). 

## more plot vomit
Soca is very easily outgoing and friendly, so she makes new friends quickly and does well in the constantly shifting social structure at the ISS corps summer youth program. Min takes a little more time to warm up to people, so she slowly finds a couple of other friends but often shadows Soca. 

### how do Soca and Min learn about cuttlefish?
In the year before going to the ISS corps summer youth program, Soca did an internship at her local Science Museum, where she was a presenter for the Current Science & Technology department. She learned about cuttlefish via a story about the military studying cuttlefish in order to mimic their camouflage abilities for soldier's camou. Soca gets very excited about cuttlefish and marine animals, especially about their strategies for movement, communication, and interspecies interactions. 

## during year long internship
### coursework
Everyone is required to take the following courses: History of the ISS and the Space Shuttle program, Philosophy of Science and Engineering, Space Swimming, Basic electronics and machine shop training. Then everyone must pick one more course from the following offerings: Exo-farming, Exo-architecture, Design and Construction of Space Shuttles. Soca chooses Exo-architecture, Min chooses Design and Construction of Space Shuttles.
