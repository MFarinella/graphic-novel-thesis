# World timeline

## The World Before the Dark Years

**2039**: First successful raw eSyrup is cultivated by scientists trying to directly interface silicon circuits with biological tissue. These scientists manage to create a yeast mutant that, when cultured with lactic acid bacteria and fed water and sand, decomposes the silicon dioxide found in most sand. The resulting culture can be heat-treated or "voltage-treated" to induce the bacterial culture to self-assemble into tissue-like sections that are able to act as any basic component of an electrical circuit (conductor, resistor, capacitor, transistor, diode, etc). Some heat treatments allow for the resulting eSyrup product to continue to be independently reconfigurable almost indefinitely (called "living eSyrup"), while other heat treatments destroy its ability to reconfigure (called "fixed eSyrup"). 

**2042**: first wave of pollution-related epidemics, with severe population reduction in several densely populated tropical areas in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. 

**2045**: The Colorado River dries up completely, throwing North America into chaos. An extremely aggressive water-borne disease wipes out several major urban areas in China and India. Tons of people get skin cancer and other such ailments and just die in droves.

**2046-47**: Great Migration, away from equatorial zones and coastal zones. 

**2048**: Ozone hole over Antarctic measured to be the biggest its ever been. 

## The Dark Years, 2049 to 2066

**2049**: Global water crisis, or "The Burning". Several major oil spills happen in close temporal proximity to each other, and the final one somehow catches on fire. A chain reaction occurs, spreading the fire throughout an ocean now choked with plastic waste. A huge swath of global ocean surface spends months engulfed in flames, destroying ecosystems and utterly disrupting the water cycle on the planet. Military action, riots, and genocide occur over the complete lack of potable water on the Earth's surface, and the brutal effects of an atmosphere damaged to a breaking point. Massive fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation from sun flares completely disrupt digital computing technology infrastructure. The vast majority of servers worldwide are wiped clean. The death toll is staggering. 

**2050**: Those who survived the first year of "The Burning" have taken refuge in caves all over the world, seeking respite from the sun and searching for aquafirs deep underground. Humans become nocturnal, coming above ground only at night, if at all. 

**2053**: Magou is born in a cave somewhere in the Mexican Peninsula.

Towards the end of the Dark Years, groups of cave dwellers on the same continent start to reach out towards each other and establish communications and trade. During this time, some of the scientists who first cultivate eSyrup realise that eSyrup can be used to filter water and air, protect humans from solar radiation, enable long-distance wireless communications, and act as rocket fuel. A heavily stratified and strict class system has now taken hold of human society. 

By the end of the Dark Years, the Biosilica is a well-established religious movement. Followers of the Biosilica religion denounce body mods, choosing instead to develop eSyrup textiles that can protect the wearer from harmful solar radiations. They evade surveillance by keeping their faces covered at all times, except when inside a private eSyrup bubble. The traditional clothing of the Biosilica can establish a non-invasive sensory connection with the wearer.

## The Age of the Space Consortium, 2066 to present day

**2066**: The Space Consortium is established as a collaborative project between the Underground Cities of North America and Europe, based in **NEED TO PICK LOCATION**. They declare that they will save humanity from forever living underground by getting humans into space again. The Space Consortium makes it their goal to get a human into space in the next 15 years. 

**2071**: Construction of the Tulum Shuttle Launch Station is completed. PQ is born.

**2072**: Magou, now an ambitious young woman of 19, decides to apply to work as a mathematician on the Space Consortium Ansible Project. 

**2075**: Space Consortium makes their first successful low orbit flight. Adi is born.

**2076**: Magou finds out that the satellite she has been working on will be used to censor global communications and monitor academics suspected of harboring critical views towards the Space Consortium. Magou and a group of colleagues try to expose the Space Consortium's plans, but the Space Consortium is able to cover everything up. The Space Consortium comes after Magou and her colleagues, and kills everyone except Magou, who makes a desperate escape into **THE RED ZONE**, aka the equatorial zone. Magou is found and saved by a community started by some of the scientists who first developed eSyrup, who grew disillusioned with the Space Consortium and the Underground Cities, and decided to go into the wilderness to make their own new world order. 

**2077**: Space Consortium successfully launches their first orbital satellite. 

**2078**: João Moreira is born.  

**2079**: The Biosilica create their first successful splice of eSyrup metal with animal cell cultures, frozen and preserved from before the Dark Years. Jina is born.

**2080**: Space Consortium successfully launches a human into space flight, who orbits the Earth and returns. Amadou is born.

**2082**: The first mechapet, a rat-like creature named Nimh, is born. Nimh lives 11 days. Eithne is born. 

**2083**: Space Consortium begins launching pieces of its first Orbital station.  

**2086**: Space Consortium's first Orbital station, **THE PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL STATION**, is completed. Space Consortium establishes a World Government based at **THE PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL STATION**. 

**2087**: First Space Barge makes its virgin flight to the **PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL STATION**. Space Consortium's satellites discover evidence of human activity on the surface of the planet. This first report is deemed a mistake and ignored. 

**2089**: First Orbital home pod is successfully launched from the **PEGGY WHITSON MEMORIAL STATION**. Within months, Orbiter population reaches 1000. 

**2091**: Orbiter population reaches 5000. 

**2092**: Night of a Thousand Burning Stars. Survivors confirm the existence of human societies on the planet's surface, primarily in the Amazon Rainforest, Vietnam, and other places with both rainforest and caves. 13-year-old Jina finds 21-year-old PQ, who survived the Space Barge explosion, and helps PQ return to the Underground Cities. 

**2094**: First large-scale effort to attempt agriculture on the planet's surface, a collaboration between the Space Consortium and various human societies that had developed on the Earth's surface, such as the Automata and the Biosilica. 

**2095**: The first Green Haven is established in the former US province Kentucky. João is 20 years old and eager to get above ground however he can, so he travels to Green Haven Kentucky to be part of the first cohort of surface agriculturists. 

**2096**: Orbiter population reaches 10,000, and the ISE Corps, a training program for youth interested in space exploration, is established. 

**2098**: Several Green Havens are now well established around the world.  

**2099**: Eithne travels to Green Haven Kentucky to work as a plant splicer, meaning she takes environmental monitoring data and uses it to genetically engineer plants to be robust to the extreme conditions on the surface. Jheri is born.

**2100**: Zalo is born. Tross is born. 

**2101**: Eithne realises that a faction in the World Gov and the Space Consortium are using the Green Havens to develop a way to genetically engineer food plants with genes that hijack the body into making nano-scale bio-data sensors, which can collect biochemical data from within the body and then wirelessly transmit that data to a remote database. Unable to decide who to trust and pregnant with Asoka, she and João decide not to expose the plot and instead, Eithne works to sabotage the experiments. Oana is born. 

**2102**: Asoka is born at Green Haven Kentucky. Rajue is born. 

**2103**: Orbiter population reaches 15,000. Min is born. Rhee is born. 

**2105**: Eithne is caught sabotaging plant splicing experiments and is arrested. João and Asoka flee Green Haven Kentucky. 

**2108**: After 3 years of hiding in the Underground Cities, trying to evade mercenaries sent to hunt them down, João and Asoka are forced to cross the **RED ZONE**. They are found by Amadou and brought to the Automata. Not knowing who to trust, João makes no mention of why they left Green Haven Kentucky, and begs for sanctuary with the Automata for the sake of 6-year-old Asoka. The Automata decide to let the Moreiras stay with them, as long as they renounce the use of any Orbiter products and never speak of the Underground Cities. 

**2114**: ISE Corps establishes the Space Asylum Program. 

**2116**: Jina falls terribly ill, and nothing the Automata do seems to help. João reveals that he has been using a World Gov medical scanner and portable Laser Atomic Manipulator (LAM) to monitor his and Asoka's health and see to their medical needs. They offer both devices to the Automata as a means of saving Jina, revealing their breach of Automata law. João also decides to tell the Automata about the circumstances surrounding their departure from Green Haven Kentucky. After much discussion, the Automata accept their offer to help Jina recover from her illness, but Magou, fearful for the safety of the Automata if they were to be caught harboring fugitives wanted by the World Government and the Space Consortium, banishes João and Asoka. Min and Asoka, who have become close friends during the Moreiras' 8 year stay with the Automata, secretly keep in touch. 

**2118**: Min completes her training as an arborist and receives her subdermal shield, in a ritual ceremony where expert artists and crafters of the Automata are injected with raw eSyrup. She applies to the Space Asylum Program. 

**2119**: Min and Asoka arrive at the ISE Corps.
