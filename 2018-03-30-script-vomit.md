### quick note 
VIRS "ships" are as much mental as physical. VIRS's can be part of many crews simultaneously. Balancing these many social contexts and roles is considered part of the art of a VIRS. 

# BIG ARC
The story needs to be about the architect and the engineer and about when they meet at the ISS corps. From the concept summary, need to flesh out these paragraphs: 

"The First VIRS (Minka) was the Architectâ€™s (Asoca's) best friend. They grew up together, and as teenagers they participated in a summer program for youth with the ISS corps, a government-run volunteer organization that provides support to the International Space Station and any shuttles traveling to and from the station. While working on the maintenance teams for the shuttles, the two friends learned a great deal about the cutting edge of space exploration technology, and saw that humanity was poised on the brink of great societal changes due to the imminent development of faster-than-light transportation and communication. The two friends realized that political power structures and the distribution of wealth would undergo incredible upheaval, and that within their lifetimes humanity would either cooperate to spread to the stars or squander our chance through greed, mismanagement, and short-sightedness.

One friend felt that if humans were to become a space-faring species, competent leaders with a unified vision needed to coordinate across global resources for developing space travel and communication. Otherwise, opportunities could be wasted in the face of political conflict or incompetence. While working for the ISS corps, she meets an urban planner who has been hired to plan renovations and expansions to the ISS. They bond over a shared passion for understanding and designing the infrastructure necessary for space exploration. After that fateful summer, this friend went on to study exo-architecture (designing and building space stations and colonies) and maintained close correspondence with her mentor as he renovated the ISS.

The other friend felt that if humans were to become a space-faring species, space travel needed to become easily accessible, and for that to happen, the knowledge, skills, and materials needed to go to space needed to be more widely available. She decided to stay with the ISS corps instead of going to university, apprenticing herself to anyone that would teach her. She eventually becomes close friends with one of the lead engineers over their shared passion for sustainability practices and the open access movement. This engineer teaches her how to build space-worthy craft and engages her in long discussions about the power of information for good and evil." 

## a couple details to think about
- Asoca and Minka knew each other from before the ISS corps summer youth program? How, if they grew up in such different environments? Maybe something like AICL, a summer camp that they went to together for years before deciding to go to ISS corps summer program instead, together. 
- Asoca: Good with grand ideas and inspiring large groups of people, though very self-deprecating and more introverted than she presents. Very generous with friends and colleagues and often cheerful, but goes through bouts of cynicism when too many take advantage of her generosity and good nature. Enjoys the quiet and wild beauty of rural living but is drawn to cities and the sensation of being part of a super-organism. Mother is an herbalist who studies plants useful for space travel (exo-hydroponics). Father is a farmer specializing in permaculture. Grew up in a small rural community.
- Minka: Meticulous worker who prefers working alone because not enough people meet her standards for competence, but loves to coordinate ambitious projects with a small group of trusted collaborators. Picky about everything: food, her friends, and how she spends her time. Pessimistic about human systems but convinced that the destructive tendencies in human nature are the result of generations of indoctrination by a corporate oligarchy. Believes in the ideal role of education to free humans from oppressive systems and to empower humans to live in a society of true equals. Mother is a mathematician who worked on the ansible but retired to teach high school. Father is an artist activist who has been protesting the application of the ansible for secret government surveillance and military oppression. Grew up in the affluent part of a large urban area.

## How to fit my research projects into the plot
During the summer youth program, all "youth cadets" conduct a science exploration. Minka and Asoca choose to study cuttlefish hunting behaviour ([**Cuttle Shuttle**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/cuttlefish-hunting-behavior/)) in order to develop new space swimming techniques based on flexible scaling of the timing of movements ([**Movement control**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/movement-control-across-timescales/)), especially for rapid stabilization in zero-G environments. 

Youth cadets that excel during the summer program are invited to spend a 1-year apprenticeship with the ISS corps, during which they learn how to maintain the shuttles and present a project exploring the life cycle of resources used to build and maintain space shuttles. Minka and Asoca become apprentices and use outdated or recycled space shuttle cameras and monitors to build interactive exhibits that teach the public about the ISS corps mission and day-to-day activities ([**Surprising Minds**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/surprising-minds-brighton/)). 

During that year, Asoca meets Urban Planner and by the end of Asoca's apprenticeship they co-write a short manifesto on the "Social Responsibilities of the Intellectually Privileged, with an especial focus on those who build infrastructure" ([**Philosophy and Ethics**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/scientific-philosophy-ethics/)). Also during that year, Minka meets Lead Engineer and they totally get off on the wrong foot. During the second half of the apprenticeship, all apprentices wishing to stay with the ISS corps instead of going to a university for baccalaureate certification are required to take courses on the ISS corps's Theories of Science and Engineering ([**Theoretical Puzzle Pieces**](http://www.danbeekim.org/brainplay/2018-02-02-theoretical-puzzle-pieces/)). Minka takes these courses and through the class discussions realizes that Lead Engineer shares some of her most fundamental values. 

# PLOT SUMMARY

## background
Asoca and Minka met each other at a summer camp for creative learning. Asoca had been going to this summer camp since she was 8. Minka didn't start coming to this camp until she was 11, at a time when Asoca was 13. Min and Soca, as they were called, became fast friends during the 4 weeks of their first summer together. 

This summer camp however was meant for children year 3 through year 12, so when Soca was 17 and Min was 15, it was Soca's last year at this summer camp. Min could technically come for another year (though she's 2 years younger, because she skipped a grade she's only one year behind Soca in school), she was really sad about coming back without Soca. 

During the year after Soca's last summer camp, they learned about the ISS corps summer youth program. It is for 15-18 year olds, regardless of their school year, as long as they haven't started a baccalaureate program of study yet. Soca and Min both apply and are offered spots in the youth program. They decide to go during the last summer before Soca goes to university. 

## plot vomit
When Min and Soca arrive, they are assigned sleeping quarters based on their ages (Min with the 15 year olds, Soca with the 17 year olds). They learn that during the day, they will spend their time in work teams, in classes, and working on science exploration projects. 

### work teams
Everyone in the summer youth program is part of a rotation that eventually has them on a work team with every other teenager in the youth program. The work teams also rotate in such a way that everyone gets exposure to every role and responsibility at the shuttle maintenance station, and everyone gets the chance to go up to the ISS in a shuttle and experience the roles of maintenance and shuttle construction up on the station. 

### coursework
Everyone is required to take the following courses: History of the ISS and the Space Shuttle program, Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Engineering, Basic electronics and machine shop training. Then everyone must pick one more course from the following offerings: Exo-farming, Exo-architecture, Design and Construction of Space Shuttles. 

### science exploration projects
In either a group or as a solo project, everyone must work on and present a project that explores the life cycle of the resources necessary to run the ISS and the space shuttles. 

## more plot vomit
Soca is very easily outgoing and friendly, so she makes new friends quickly and does well in the constantly shifting social structure at the ISS corps summer youth program. Min takes a little more time to warm up to people, so she slowly finds a couple of other friends but often shadows Soca.
