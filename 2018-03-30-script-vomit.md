### quick note 
VIRS "ships" are as much mental as physical. VIRS's can be part of many crews simultaneously. Balancing these many social contexts and roles is considered part of the art of a VIRS. 

# BIG ARC
The story needs to be about the architect and the engineer and about when they meet at the ISS corps. From the concept summary, need to flesh out these paragraphs: 

"The First VIRS (Minka) was the Architectâ€™s (Asoca's) best friend. They grew up together, and as teenagers they participated in a summer program for youth with the ISS corps, a government-run volunteer organization that provides support to the International Space Station and any shuttles traveling to and from the station. While working on the maintenance teams for the shuttles, the two friends learned a great deal about the cutting edge of space exploration technology, and saw that humanity was poised on the brink of great societal changes due to the imminent development of faster-than-light transportation and communication. The two friends realized that political power structures and the distribution of wealth would undergo incredible upheaval, and that within their lifetimes humanity would either cooperate to spread to the stars or squander our chance through greed, mismanagement, and short-sightedness.

One friend felt that if humans were to become a space-faring species, competent leaders with a unified vision needed to coordinate across global resources for developing space travel and communication. Otherwise, opportunities could be wasted in the face of political conflict or incompetence. While working for the ISS corps, she meets an urban planner who has been hired to plan renovations and expansions to the ISS. They bond over a shared passion for understanding and designing the infrastructure necessary for space exploration. After that fateful summer, this friend went on to study exo-architecture (designing and building space stations and colonies) and maintained close correspondence with her mentor as he renovated the ISS.

The other friend felt that if humans were to become a space-faring species, space travel needed to become easily accessible, and for that to happen, the knowledge, skills, and materials needed to go to space needed to be more widely available. She decided to stay with the ISS corps instead of going to university, apprenticing herself to anyone that would teach her. She eventually becomes close friends with one of the lead engineers over their shared passion for sustainability practices and the open access movement. This engineer teaches her how to build space-worthy craft and engages her in long discussions about the power of information for good and evil." 

## a couple details to think about
- Asoca and Minka knew each other from before the ISS corps summer youth program? How, if they grew up in such different environments? Maybe something like AICL, a summer camp that they went to together for years before deciding to go to ISS corps summer program instead, together. 

## How to fit my research projects into the plot
During the summer youth program, all "youth cadets" conduct a science exploration. Minka and Asoca choose to study cuttlefish hunting behaviour ([**Cuttle Shuttle**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/cuttlefish-hunting-behavior/)) in order to develop new space swimming techniques based on flexible scaling of the timing of movements ([**Movement control**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/movement-control-across-timescales/)), especially for rapid stabilization in zero-G environments. 

Youth cadets that excel during the summer program are invited to spend a 1-year apprenticeship with the ISS corps, during which they learn how to maintain the shuttles and present a project exploring the life cycle of resources used to build and maintain space shuttles. Minka and Asoca become apprentices and use outdated or recycled space shuttle cameras and monitors to build interactive exhibits that teach the public about the ISS corps mission and day-to-day activities ([**Surprising Minds**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/surprising-minds-brighton/)). 

During that year, Asoca meets Urban Planner and by the end of Asoca's apprenticeship they co-write a short manifesto on the "Social Responsibilities of the Intellectually Privileged, with an especial focus on those who build infrastructure" ([**Philosophy and Ethics**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/scientific-philosophy-ethics/)). Also during that year, Minka meets Lead Engineer and they totally get off on the wrong foot. During the second half of the apprenticeship, all apprentices wishing to stay with the ISS corps instead of going to a university for baccalaureate certification are required to take courses on the ISS corps's Theories of Science and Engineering ([**Theoretical Puzzle Pieces**](http://www.danbeekim.org/brainplay/2018-02-02-theoretical-puzzle-pieces/)). Minka takes these courses and through the class discussions realizes that Lead Engineer shares some of her most fundamental values.
