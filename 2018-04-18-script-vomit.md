Set in the very near future of our reality. Some political setup set about 40 years in the future: after Trump, USA rejoins Paris Climate accord and many efforts to stem the effects of climate change seem to be working. Education crisis is at a head, cities are overcrowded, and rural communities are dying. But we've made it to Mars, and we've established a research base on the planet. The needs of the Mars mission have revitalized funding and interest in the ISS, which in turn has resurrected the Space Shuttles idea. Many of the scientists and engineers who once worked with Elon Musk and SpaceX have gone on to establish space exploration companies and consortiums all over the world. 

Some of these folks have developed an interest in education, in order to sustain interest in space exploration into the next generation, and to find the best and the brightest for their projects. This is especially appropriate, as education has become a complete extension of the marketplace. Students obsessively and aggressively compete to complete the pre-university checklist of CV items. Topics of study are only considered valuable if they lead to well-paying jobs. 

To groom more youth to work in space exploration industries, these ex-SpaceX people create a training program for international youth called the ISS Corps, where youth learn to design, build, and maintain space shuttles that can carry humans, equipment, and other resources to the ISS and return to Earth. The ISS is now an important way-station for maintaining communication and supply chains to Mars. The ISS Corps is affiliated with the Space University, and quickly becomes popular amongst the well-educated elite of the world. 

Climate change and wars on Earth are still creating refugee populations everywhere. The founders of the ISS Corps convince the UN to implement a refugee re-education process that gives young refugees the option of joining the ISS Corps in an apprenticeship arrangement that allows them to take part in the ISS Corps as scholarship students, in exchange for working on the service crews at planetside stations. This is seen as a politically suave move, something to increase the diversity of the ISS Corps student body. 

Mini has joined the ISS Corps in this way. Her family was part of the well-educated elite of a city somewhere that is now fallen to civil war thanks to a massive food shortage due to drought.
