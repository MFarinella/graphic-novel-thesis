# new context

Set in the very near future of our reality. Trump was president for 2 terms and it was terrible. Afterwards, the USA rejoined Paris Climate accord while Al Gore quietly spearheaded numerous global projects to increase urban sustainablity and renewable energy development. A variety of efforts to stem the effects of climate change seem to be working, and humanity lives in an uneasy balance with nature. Education is still in crisis, cities are overcrowded, and rural communities are dying. But we've made it to Mars, and we've established a research base on the planet. There's a lot of talk in the news about exciting developments in agricultural science that will improve exo-hydroponics (plants useful for space travel) and permaculture on the Mars research base. The needs of the Mars mission have revitalized funding and interest in the ISS, which in turn has resurrected the Space Shuttles idea. Many of the scientists and engineers who once worked with Elon Musk and SpaceX have gone on to establish space exploration companies and consortiums all over the world. 

Some of these folks have developed an interest in education, in order to sustain interest in space exploration into the next generation, and to find the best and the brightest for their projects. This is especially appropriate, as education has become a complete extension of the marketplace. Students obsessively and aggressively compete to complete the pre-university checklist of CV items. Topics of study are only considered valuable if they lead to well-paying jobs. 

To groom more youth to work in space exploration industries, these ex-SpaceX people create an international training program for called the ISS Corps, where students learn to design, build, and maintain space shuttles that can carry humans, equipment, and other resources to the ISS and return to Earth. The ISS is now an important way-station for maintaining communication and supply chains to Mars. The ISS Corps is affiliated with the Space University and several nations' military and space exploration departments, and quickly becomes popular amongst the well-educated elite of the world. 

Climate change and wars on Earth are still creating refugee populations everywhere. The founders of the ISS Corps convince the UN to implement a refugee re-education process that gives refugees the option of joining the ISS Corps in an apprenticeship arrangement that allows them to take part in the ISS Corps as scholarship students, in exchange for working on the service crews at planetside stations. This is seen as a politically suave move, something to increase the diversity of the ISS Corps student body and increase the appeal of the ISS Corps mission as a global endeavor, it's great PR. Others see it as just another version of exploitation and social oppression. 

Mini has joined the ISS Corps in this way. Her family was part of the well-educated elite of Silicon Valley, which is now fallen to civil war in West America thanks to a massive food shortage due to drought. She is pragmatic about her situation, but still carries herself with pride. There is tension between the refugee youth who join the ISS Corps as scholarship students, versus the non-scholarship students, who often come from very affluent families in parts of the world that have managed to keep the grim realities of climate change at bay for one reason or another. The scholarship students must work as janitors, cafeteria staff, etc. in the ISS Corps facilities, so they see a sharp divide between how service industry staff are treated versus administrative, research, and engineering staff. Asoca, on the other hand, is a non-scholarship student, coming from a small agricultural research village on the Orkney Islands, affluent for its ties to military research on space farming and one of the few natural spaces left on planet Earth. She is very driven and studious, but has had an easy life. 

This thesis is the "origin story" of the Benevolent Dictator Asoca and the First VIRS Min -- what motivates them, where they get their strength from, how their philosophies developed. The story arc is mostly focused on how Asoca, a girl who wanted to build glorified tree houses, grew up to become a benevolent dictator, the one to lead humanity into their first galactic empire. How does she win everyone's support? How does she remain society's darling as she gains power and threatens the status quo? 

The ISS Corps is now a university level training institute for the career class "Interplanetary Travel and Communications". Anyone over the age of 18 may apply to attend, and several specialization fields are taught, to be noted on a degree as an "ISS Corps certification in Interplanetary Travel and Communications, with specializations in ...". Students are expected to take 6 years to graduate, most commonly with 2 or 3 specializations. 

Asoca and Min meet each other in the ISS Corps. Asoca is privileged and naive; Min is a climate change refugee and pragmatic to a fault. Asoca believes that good leadership can bring about big changes with the least amount of suffering, while Min believes that only anarchy, which is both the freedom to do what you want in addition to the empowerment and responsibility of truly understanding what you want in order to do it, and systems robust in keeping power well distributed, will keep humans from enslaving each other for their own convenience. They fall in love, and deeply influence each other's model of the world before they part ways upon graduation. 

# integrating research into the plot

- Cuttle Shuttle dataset: an obscure study from the past which inspired many aspects of current space swimming techniques. 
  - From Diogo: "Use the cuttlefish movement stabilization data not only for human swimming in space but also for space station habitats/modules connection protocols (like, a mechanical version of the tentacles used to grad and connect modules in a secure and efficient way)."
- HIVE Tracker: now a well-developed off-the-shelf "tinkering" component, like raspberry pi or arduino, used by students, hackers, etc, to track, document, and analyse movement. 
- Surprising Minds: field neuroscience is now a well-established field and considered a very important part of space exploration. The ISS Corps curriculum teaches field neuroscience and uses interactive art-science installations to fulfill science communication and public engagement requirements of their funding/it's great PR. 

The main plot will integrate/be a showcase of the struggle between open loop causal reactive machine versus closed loop perceptual control system models of the brain. The Theoretical Puzzle Pieces, Philosophy and Ethics, and other theory stuff will get integrated into the conversations between characters, and as part of what certain characters believe. 

# background vomit

Soca's home is idyllic and protected, but then she leaves it to go to the ISS Corps and through her eyes we see the more grim aspects of her reality. She hasn't spent much time outside her home village, but she has visited the nearby city and has seen how differently other people live from herself and her village. 

in the sense that she has to go from wanting to build glorified tree houses to becoming benevolent dictator of the human intergalactic empire, there's a turning point in there, and I kind of see it happening when she meets Min at ISS Corps. There they "corrupt" each other, because min realises that you need the benevolent dictator to drastically push society in a new direction, and soca realises that when benevolent dictators die, very careful plans must be made, and lots of robustness built into those plans, to keep that new direction going. and the new direction we want is respectful, healthy, mature anarchy, where we take advantage of our evolutionary power to distribute well: distribute ourselves through many environments, distribute tasks when solving problems together, distribute resources to stay connected between our distributed locations, etc. 

so the idea i had was that soca starts to work in space hydroponics and becomes very influential because she's feeding everyone, and once climate change and wars on earth start really fucking up food supplies and chains, humanity starts relying more and more on space farms. corrupt leaders on Earth try to manipulate people using food as leverage, and soca says, fuck that, here's food with no strings attached. 

soca also needs to develop iron will in order to become a benevolent dictator. I think that comes from her mother. 

also ISS Corps is no longer a summer youth program, it's basically a technical institute. 

# plot vomit
Story starts with separate storylines for both Soca and Min as they each prepare to go to the ISS Corps. 

Min is still in shock that her city is gone and that she and her family are refugees. She's only had a few months to get used to the idea when she learns about the ISS Corps and applies. She is accepted and arrives at the ISS Corps Institute ("the institute"). As a scholarship student, she is expected to maintain a part-time position on a service crew (cleaning staff, security staff, supply room staff, etc). She joins the security staff - was she allowed to pick? is there criteria for different crews? what's the culture within those crews?

Soca's mother's dying wish was for Soca to attend the ISS Corps Institute. Soca had always had an interest in architecture but was more interested in trees and plants on Earth rather than outer space. She arrives at the institute reluctant and entitled to feel robbed of her childhood dream.
