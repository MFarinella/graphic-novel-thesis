# new context

Set in the very near future of our reality. Trump was president for 2 terms and it was terrible. Afterwards, the USA rejoined Paris Climate accord while Al Gore quietly spearheaded numerous global projects to increase urban sustainablity and renewable energy development. A variety of efforts to stem the effects of climate change seem to be working, and humanity lives in an uneasy balance with nature. Education is still in crisis, cities are overcrowded, and rural communities are dying. But we've made it to Mars, and we've established a research base on the planet. There's a lot of talk in the news about exciting developments in agricultural science that will improve exo-hydroponics (plants useful for space travel) and permaculture on the Mars research base. The needs of the Mars mission have revitalized funding and interest in the ISS, which has become an important refueling point for space vessels. This has in turn resurrected the idea of a reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system, akin to the US Space Shuttle program of late 20th century. Many of the scientists and engineers who once worked with Elon Musk and SpaceX have gone on to establish space exploration companies and consortiums all over the world. 

Some of these folks have developed an interest in education, in order to sustain interest in space exploration into the next generation, and to find the best and the brightest for their projects. This is especially appropriate, as education has become a complete extension of the marketplace. Students obsessively and aggressively compete to complete the pre-university checklist of CV items. Topics of study are only considered valuable if they lead to well-paying jobs. 

To groom more youth to work in space exploration industries, these ex-SpaceX people create an international training program called the ISS Corps, where youth from around the world spend 1-3 years at various planet-side launch stations learning about space travel and communication while helping maintain the space shuttles that can carry humans, equipment, and other resources to and from the ISS. The ISS is now an important way-station for maintaining communication and supply chains to Mars, in addition to serving as a refueling station and base of operations for other space endeavors. The ISS Corps is a year-round pre-university training institution that both prepares youth for Space University (which is in turn affiliated with several nations' military and space exploration departments), and it quickly becomes popular amongst the well-educated elite of the world. 

Climate change and wars on Earth are still creating refugee populations everywhere. The founders of the ISS Corps convince the UN to implement a refugee re-education process that gives refugees the option of joining the ISS Corps as scholarship students, in which their application and tuition fees are waived in exchange for working on the service crews at planetside stations. This is seen as a politically suave move, something to increase the diversity of the ISS Corps student body and increase the appeal of the ISS Corps mission as a global endeavor, it's great PR. Others see it as just another version of exploitation and social oppression. 

Mini has joined the ISS Corps in this way. Her family was part of the well-educated elite of Silicon Valley, which is now fallen to civil war in West America thanks to a massive food shortage due to drought. She is pragmatic about her situation, but still carries herself with pride. There is tension between the refugee youth who join the ISS Corps as scholarship students, versus the non-scholarship students, who often come from very affluent families in parts of the world that have managed to keep the grim realities of climate change at bay for one reason or another. The scholarship students must work as janitors, cafeteria staff, etc. in the ISS Corps facilities, so they see a sharp divide between how service industry staff are treated versus administrative, research, and engineering staff. Asoca, on the other hand, is a non-scholarship student, coming from a small agricultural research village on the Orkney Islands, affluent for its ties to military research on space farming and one of the few natural spaces left on planet Earth. She is very driven and studious, but has had an easy life. 

This thesis is the "origin story" of the Benevolent Dictator Asoca and the First VIRS Min -- what motivates them, where they get their strength from, how their philosophies developed. The story arc is mostly focused on how Asoca, a girl who wanted to build glorified tree houses, grew up to become a benevolent dictator, the one to lead humanity into their first galactic empire. How does she win everyone's support? How does she remain society's darling as she gains power and threatens the status quo? 

The ISS Corps is a year-round pre-university-level training institute for the career class "Interplanetary Travel and Communications". Anyone over the age of 16 may apply to attend, and several specialization fields are taught, to be noted on the final certification as an "ISS Corps apprentice-level certification in Interplanetary Travel and Communications, with specializations in ...". Students who excel are recommended for Space University, which gives them a competitive edge in the application process. The ISS Corps also offers a 4-year vocational certification at the university level, aimed at those students who cannot afford to attend Space University. 

Asoca and Min meet each other in the ISS Corps. Asoca is privileged and naive; Min is a climate change refugee and pragmatic to a fault. Asoca believes that good leadership can bring about big changes with the least amount of suffering, while Min believes that only anarchy -- meaning both the freedom to do exactly what you want in addition to the empowerment and responsibility of truly understanding what you want in order to do it -- and systems robust in keeping power well distributed, will keep humans from enslaving each other for their own convenience. They fall in love, and deeply influence each other's model of the world before they part ways upon graduation.

*The great Colorado River is now but a forgotten memory. The lucrative farms in northern California, bread basket of West America, sucked it dry in 2082, ruining that year's crops and sparking riots.*

*The lack of sufficient alternatives has plunged the nation into a seemingly endless drought, and the anger, some righteous, all turned into fear. Civil war now rages.*

*The **SPACE CONSORTIUM** ran the numbers and found that a civil war affecting one of their legacy technological strongholds, Silicon Valley, would be massively unprofitable. They decided to offer asylum to the families of any young West American refugees willing to become a "scholarship student" at the ISS Corps -- their flagship educational project for teenagers, an international training program for youth interested in career class "Interplanetary Travel and Communications".*

*The scholarship meant that these students could attend the ISS Corps far free, and receive financial support for their university-level training of choice.*

*It also meant that they committed 5 years of their wage-earning years to the **SPACE CONSORTIUM**.*

# integrating research into the plot

- Cuttle Shuttle dataset: an obscure study from the past which inspired many aspects of current space swimming techniques. 
  - From Diogo: "Use the cuttlefish movement stabilization data not only for human swimming in space but also for space station habitats/modules connection protocols (like, a mechanical version of the tentacles used to grad and connect modules in a secure and efficient way)."
- HIVE Tracker: now a well-developed off-the-shelf "tinkering" component, like raspberry pi or arduino, used by students, hackers, etc, to track, document, and analyse movement. 
- Surprising Minds: field neuroscience is now a well-established field and considered a very important part of space exploration. The ISS Corps curriculum teaches field neuroscience and uses interactive art-science installations to fulfill science communication and public engagement requirements of their funding/it's great PR. 

The main plot will integrate the struggle between open loop causal reactive machine versus closed loop perceptual control system models of the brain. The Theoretical Puzzle Pieces, Philosophy and Ethics, and other theory stuff will get integrated into the conversations between characters, and as part of what certain characters believe. 

# ISS Corps
The ISS Corps program that Asoca and Min attend is at the Kennedy Memorial Shuttle Launch and Maintenance Station, built just north of the old ruins of the historic Kennedy Space Center. ISS Corps students are referred to as "youth cadets". The youth cadets participate in work crews to help the station staff with their duties, conduct research with a science crew to study an aspect of space travel and communication, and live with a home crew. 

During their induction week, first-year students explore and choose a "home crew". Each home crew displays their engineering and team working prowess by spending this first week hosting fun activities, meals (which are shared together with all home crews together; each home crew takes 2 meals over the course of the week to show off their collective food making prowess), and renovating their home structures to accommodate new youth cadets, based on the number of youth cadets in the crew graduated the previous year from the youth program. New youth cadets are given temporary sleeping structures for the first week, and are expected to wander from home crew to home crew, getting to know them, checking out their aesthetics and personalities, working with them, hanging out with them. New cadets usually find a home crew within the first few days and end up finishing the building of their own sleeping structures.

The Kennedy Memorial Shuttle Launch and Maintenance Station "home crews":
- CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE: They are generally preoccupied with circus and theatrical storytelling, bodily morphologies/anatomies/physiologies, and how thought and movement are connected. They like to build aquariums, terrariums, and playgrounds for humans of all sizes. Their home structures are kinetic and encourage daily training. They maintain a dance studio and theater. 
- CYBERPHILIA: generally preoccupied with technologically-mediated communication, control, and governance. They love to tinker with robotics, AI, automated processes, and electronics. They also build wired and wireless networks, and play lots of video games (historical console/PC games, VR/AR games, simulator room games). They maintain the digital tools maker space. 
- MENDELEEVERS: generally preoccupied with using simple old-fashioned methods and techniques from chemistry, physics, and traditional hand crafts to build both beautiful and practical art and devices. They like to play "what if...in space?", in which a situation is invented in which something breaks out in space, and no internet is available, and very few technologically optimized tools are available, and thus one must macgyver a solution using un-networked, pre-digital tech tools. They maintain the machine shop and workspaces for traditional hand crafts. 
- INFRADESTRUCTORS: preoccupied with understanding the basic facilities, services, and installations needed for the healthy functioning of a society or organization, and with "un-black-boxing" these facilities, services, and installations (meaning that they want to know how things like plumbing, electricity, sewage systems, etc work, and then they want to modify these systems and document these systems well enough that other people can play/hack with them). They liase with the station management team and maintain the utilities shared by the home crews. 

Home crews are unique to each ISS Corps station, and have their own history, culture, and traditions. 

To help the cadets plan their science exploration projects, the next 2 weeks after induction week everyone gets a refresher course on the history and mission of the ISS Corps (it's meant to be taught by different lecturers each year, to give different perspectives on the history and highlight different details based on the lecturer's focus/interests). The mission of the ISS Corps is to ensure a mutually benefitial exchange of knowledge and resources between Earth and Space. This mission includes providing a "unique learning experience to the youth of our planetary community", in order to keep the knowledge and wisdom of this endeavor alive for future generations.

Because the ISS Corps is open to any pre-university youth over the age of 16, the ISS Corps students tend to be between 16 and 18 years old. Students are designated as 1st, 2nd, or 3rd years based on how many years they've attended ISS Corps, not based on their age. In addition, those who stay with the ISS Corps for vocational training tend to maintain close connections with their old home crews, and often stop by for a chat, a meal, or some other social event. 

ISS Corps is quite competitive -- less than 15% of applicants are accepted into the program. It also has a reputation for about 25% of the first-years dropping out because they can't handle some aspect of life in the ISS Corps, which is very socially intense and intellectually challenging. In addition, in order to come back for a 2nd or 3rd year, 1st year cadets must be recommended by their home crews. 

3 years is the maximum length of time that a student may remain in the ISS Corps. After that, they are expected to have completed their apprenticeship certifications; some complete their certifications in 2 years, very rarely does anyone complete their certification in 1 year. Most ISS Corps graduates go on to attend Space University, which has now been relocated to its own geosynchronous space station. A significant minority stay with the ISS Corps to complete their 4-year vocational training, which can stand in place of a university degree but is much more specialised and not considered quite as prestigious.

# background vomit

Soca's home is idyllic and protected, but then she leaves it to go to the ISS Corps and through her eyes we see the more grim aspects of her reality. She hasn't spent much time outside her home village, but she has visited the nearby city and has seen how differently other people live from herself and her village. 

Soca has to go from wanting to build glorified tree houses to becoming benevolent dictator of the human intergalactic empire. There's a turning point in there, and I kind of see it happening when she meets Min at ISS Corps. There they "corrupt" each other, because min realises that you need the benevolent dictator to drastically push society in a new direction, and soca realises that when benevolent dictators die, very careful plans must be made, and lots of robustness built into those plans, to keep that new direction going. and the new direction we want is respectful, healthy, mature anarchy, where we take advantage of our evolutionary power to distribute well: distribute ourselves through many environments, distribute tasks when solving problems together, distribute resources to stay connected between our distributed locations, etc. 

so the idea i had was that soca starts to work in space hydroponics and becomes very influential because she's feeding everyone, and once climate change and wars on earth start really fucking up food supplies and chains, humanity starts relying more and more on space farms. corrupt leaders on Earth try to manipulate people using food as leverage, and soca says, fuck that, here's food with no strings attached. 

soca also needs to develop iron will in order to become a benevolent dictator. I think that comes from her mother. 

I think Min should already be at the ISS Corps by the time Soca arrives.
