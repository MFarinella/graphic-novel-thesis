# super short setup

Once upon a time, a little less than one hundred years in the future, education is still in crisis, cities are overcrowded, and rural communities are dying. But we've made it to Mars, and the allure of technology and materialism continues to fuel steep social stratification. Natural spaces on the planet are dwindling into those few areas which are explicitly protected by government or corporate interests, which are turning less and less towards preserving the Earth's biological heritage and more towards winning the race to control and exploit the Earth's resources. In these last decades of the 21st century, the economic ratrace births a rather unusual school called the International Space Station (ISS) Corps, where teen-aged youth cadets live, study, and work at maintenance and launch stations for ISS space shuttles. While learning how to design, build, and maintain space shuttles, youth cadets also conduct field neuroscience experiments as part of collaborative, self-directed research teams. 

The horrors of our current society and the joys of our personal knowledge-building experiences are reflected in this story, which we use to help us see reality in new ways. This thesis presents two pressing needs in our society: 1) re-learning how to build trust, and 2) regaining our evolutionary ability to distribute ourselves across various environments, as we find ourselves mal-adapted to survive without our infrastructures of convenience within increasingly over-crowded cities. This thesis proposes to tackle both objectives with better teaching, and discusses how neuroscience can guide this endeavor.

# new context

Set in the very near future of our reality. Trump was president for 2 terms and it was terrible. Afterwards, the USA rejoined Paris Climate accord while Al Gore and the [Climate Reality Leadership Corps](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/leadership-corps) quietly spearheaded numerous global projects to increase urban sustainablity and renewable energy development. A variety of efforts to stem the effects of climate change seem to be working, and humanity lives in an uneasy balance with nature. Education is still in crisis, cities are overcrowded, and rural communities are dying. But we've made it to Mars, and we've established a research base on the planet. There's a lot of talk in the news about exciting developments in agricultural science that will improve exo-hydroponics (plants useful for space travel) and permaculture on the Mars research base. The needs of the Mars mission have revitalized funding and interest in the International Space Station (ISS), which has become an important refueling point for space vessels. This has in turn resurrected the idea of a reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system, akin to the US Space Shuttle program of late 20th century. Many of the scientists and engineers who once worked with Elon Musk and SpaceX have gone on to establish space exploration companies and consortiums all over the world. 

Some of these folks have developed an interest in education, in order to sustain interest in space exploration into the next generation, and to find the best and the brightest for their projects. This is especially appropriate, as education has become a complete extension of the marketplace. Students obsessively and aggressively compete to complete the pre-university checklist of CV items. Topics of study are only considered valuable if they lead to well-paying jobs. 

To groom more youth to work in space exploration industries, these ex-SpaceX people create an international training program called the ISS Corps, where youth from around the world spend 1-3 years at various planet-side launch stations learning about space travel and communication while helping maintain the space shuttles that can carry humans, equipment, and other resources to and from the ISS. The ISS is now an important way-station for maintaining communication and supply chains to Mars, in addition to serving as a refueling station and base of operations for other space endeavors. The ISS Corps is a year-round pre-university training institution that both prepares youth for Space University (which is in turn affiliated with several nations' military and space exploration departments), and it quickly becomes popular amongst the well-educated elite of the world. 

Climate change and wars on Earth are still creating refugee populations everywhere. The founders of the ISS Corps convince the UN to implement a refugee re-education process that gives refugees the option of joining the ISS Corps as scholarship students, in which their application and tuition fees are waived in exchange for working on the service crews at planetside stations. This is seen as a politically suave move, something to increase the diversity of the ISS Corps student body and increase the appeal of the ISS Corps mission as a global endeavor, it's great PR. Others see it as just another version of exploitation and social oppression. 

Min has joined the ISS Corps in this way. Her family was part of the well-educated elite of Silicon Valley, which is now fallen to civil war in West America thanks to a massive food shortage due to drought. She is pragmatic about her situation, but still carries herself with pride. There is tension between the refugee youth who join the ISS Corps as scholarship students, versus the non-scholarship students, who often come from very affluent families in parts of the world that have managed to keep the grim realities of climate change at bay for one reason or another. The scholarship students must work as janitors, cafeteria staff, etc. in the ISS Corps facilities, so they see a sharp divide between how service industry staff are treated versus administrative, research, and engineering staff. Asoca, on the other hand, is a non-scholarship student, coming from a small agricultural research village on the Orkney Islands, affluent for its ties to military research on space farming and one of the few natural spaces left on planet Earth. She is very driven and studious, but has had an easy life. 

This thesis is the "origin story" of the Benevolent Dictator Asoca and the First VIRS Min -- what motivates them, where they get their strength from, how their philosophies developed. The story arc is mostly focused on how Asoca, a girl who wanted to build glorified tree houses, grew up to become a benevolent dictator, the one to lead humanity into their first galactic empire. How does she win everyone's support? How does she remain society's darling as she gains power and threatens the status quo? 

The ISS Corps is a year-round pre-university-level training institute for the career class "Interplanetary Travel and Communications". Anyone over the age of 16 may apply to attend, and several specialization fields are taught, to be noted on the final certification as an "ISS Corps apprentice-level certification in Interplanetary Travel and Communications, with specializations in ...". Students who excel are recommended for Space University, which gives them a competitive edge in the application process. The ISS Corps also offers a 4-year vocational certification at the university level, aimed at those students who cannot afford to attend Space University. 

Asoca and Min meet each other in the ISS Corps. Asoca is privileged and naive; Min is a climate change refugee and pragmatic to a fault. Asoca believes that good leadership can bring about big changes with the least amount of suffering, while Min believes that only anarchy -- meaning both the freedom to do exactly what you want in addition to the empowerment and responsibility of truly understanding what you want in order to do it -- and systems robust in keeping power well distributed, will keep humans from enslaving each other for their own convenience. They fall in love, and deeply influence each other's model of the world before they part ways upon graduation. 

# plot vomit

*script vomit is in italics*, **descriptions of the plot are in bold**, **BOLD NAMES IN ALL CAPS ARE PLACEHOLDERS**.

*The great Colorado River is now but a forgotten memory. The lucrative farms in northern California, bread basket of West America, sucked it dry in 2092, ruining that year's crops and sparking riots.*

*The lack of sufficient alternatives has plunged the nation into a seemingly endless drought, and the anger, some righteous, has all turned into fear. The horrors of the GREAT NORTH AMERICAN WAR OF 2047 that birthed West America are still fresh in the minds of grandparents, but that doesn't stop the country from imploding into chaos and violence.*

*The **SPACE CONSORTIUM** ran the numbers and found that a civil war affecting one of their legacy technological strongholds, Silicon Valley, would be massively unprofitable.*

Corporate shill: *"We cannot allow the unrest in West America to disrupt the construction of the new shuttle launch pad in Old North Carolina. It's only been 10 years since we regained some semblence of economic stability in North America, and we must not lose the precious ground we gained."*

*They decided to offer asylum to the families of any young West American refugees willing to become a "scholarship student" at the ISS Corps -- their flagship educational project for teenagers, an international training program for youth interested in career class "Interplanetary Travel and Communications".*

*The scholarship meant that these students could attend the ISS Corps for free, and receive financial support for their university-level training of choice.*

*It also meant that they committed 5 years of their wage-earning years to the **SPACE CONSORTIUM**.*

*Soon enough, applications from young refugees began pouring into the ISS Corps. The **SPACE CONSORTIUM** was applauded for their great humanitarian effort and dedication to diversity.* 

**Min is with her family in a hospital room where her mother is being treated for injuries sustained while escaping the riots in their hometown of Berkeley, West America. They are now in Vancouver, Canada, because the hospitals in West America won't even let you through the front door without an insurance card. Min's family was part of the well-educated elite of Silicon Valley, which is now been destroyed by the riots in West America sparked by a massive food shortage after a brutal drought killed over 80% of the nation's farms.** 

**While Min's mother is recovering in the hospital, she finds an advert about the ISS Corps. She urges Min to apply, who has been obsessed with space travel ever since she took a ride in a space shuttle as a small child. Min is initially excited to hear about the SPACE CONSORTIUM'S offer to waive tuition to the ISS Corps, but she is reluctant to leave her family after the trauma of being driven out of their home. To make her feel even worse, her parents are activists who protest the use of the ansible for secret government surveillance and military oppression, and while the SPACE CONSORTIUM hasn't done anything like that directly themselves, their members include several economically affluent and morally questionable organizations, so they are criticised for nurturing an environment which condones surveillance and oppression. Min's parents also don't like the conditions of the scholarship, but they also see very few other options for getting Min the certifications she needs in order to work in space travel. Her parents are also in a position with little options, as they lost everything when they fled West America. The whole family has been relying completely on the generosity of Vancouver General Hospital for nearly a year, and they all agree that with this scholarship, they have a chance to regain their dignity and independence.**

**The Climate Change Reality Project has now trained so many people in the world that all kinds of grassroots environmental organizations have started to incubate quite naturally, as more and more people develop sustainable daily habits and sensibilities. Unfortunately they are still massively outnumbered by those still tied to life in the huge urban centers, where every amenity could be delivered, straight to your bed in some cases, for an easy, "convenient" price. The fake news crisis revealed just how truly incapable humans had become at building trust, and the distrustful masses now lean heavily on brand names to flag trustworthy sources of information and moral judgement.**

**A new generation of urban farmers, PROTO-VIRS, living at the fringes of these urban tumours have been taking over abandoned million-dollar apartments (another "convenient" price, just half the price of last year's Volkwagon e-Mini, perfect for your government mandated 2-children limited family! *plastic smile*) and turning them into farming schools. After a decade of bliss, the SPACE CONSORTIUM found the PROTO-VIRS graduates so competent and their farming so successful that they gave the PROTO-VIRS an offer they couldn't refuse -- give SPACE CONSORTIUM their research, and SPACE CONSORTIUM will guarantee the PROTO-VIRS "green havens", places protected from the onslaught of urban development. In short, the PROTO-VIRS agreed to keep pockets of the planet natural in order to conduct agricultural research for the benefit of a space exploration corporation.**

notes on the above: make this a story told by one character to another. maybe Min to Asoca? Or maybe a teacher?

**The PROTO-VIRS and the SPACE CONSORTIUM have a mutually respectful but skeptical attitude towards each other. The PROTO-VIRS realize that they need to preserve a secret set of knowledge and traditions, teaching their students how to guard against the mild-mannered and accommodating facade of the SPACE CONSORTIUM. Asoca's mother is a student of the PROTO-VIRS, trained in GREEN HAVEN DEVON and stationed at GREEN HAVEN SHETLAND with her husband, a permaculture farmer from Devon. They raise Asoca on an agricultural research station as loyal scientists of the SPACE CONSORTIUM, but that is a facade that hides their knowledge and practice of the history and traditions of the PROTO-VIRS, and their hope for a humanity mature enough to live in true freedom, without slavery of any kind. The PROTO-VIRS have realised the lesson of their own, voluntary slavery: in the face of brutally aggressive urbanization, fueled by coldly logical capitalism, natural spaces and biological diversity on this planet will always be in danger. Now the PROTO-VIRS search for ways to preserve the biological heritage of the Earth.**

note: maybe this whole thing is a story told by a VIRS, several generations later?

**Asoca has dreamed of joining the ISS Corps and studying at Space University, just like her mother, ever since she could remember. She is going through her offer letter to join the ISS Corps while cuddled up with her mother on a bench swing in a beautiful garden. Asoca is nervous about leaving GREEN HAVEN SHETLAND and going to APPALACHIA, her first trip across an ocean. She will be very far from the familiar faces, sights, smells, and sounds of her home, where she's lived since she was born at the local hospital 16 years ago. But she's also excited -- in the last year, she's been helping her mother research plants useful for space travel, and she has many ideas about how to build better space architecture to facilitate keeping plants alive in space. She's also excited by the possibility of meeting other children raised by PROTO-VIRS, which her mother assures her is highly likely in the ISS Corps.**

**During Asoca's induction week at the Kennedy Memorial Shuttle Launch and Maintenance Station ("the Kennedy Station"), built just south of the old ruins of the historic Kennedy Space Center, she completely resonates with the CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE's ethos and home structures. Her cheery attitude is endearing to most but annoying to some, especially Min, who is now a 2nd-year cadet on the CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE home crew. Min is now readily acknowledged as the best space swimmer currently studying at the ISS Corps, and she's beaten nearly every space swimming record the school holds. But in the last year, Min has realised the truth of the SPACE CONSORTIUM's "scholarship" -- she is expected to work part-time on the ISS Corps' service crews (janitorial, cafeteria, grounds keeping, waste & recycling, stores & mail) for every year of her apprenticeship. This only strengthens Min's resolve to be amongst the top 10 students in her graduating cohort (the top 10 receive fully paid fellowships for their university level training), so she studies and trains her space swimming skills with furious discipline. She is, by her own admission, "picky" about her collaborators, and not very extroverted; she prefers to watch the first-years from afar, and shows friendliness only in quieter moments. Min judges Asoca to be naive and privileged, unaware of life outside her own tiny bubble, until the home crew has a training session, and Min sees Asoca's more disciplined, martial side when Asoca plays capoeira. Min finds herself unable to stop watching Asoca, and is drawn to get to know her.**

**Min is one of many of cadets who share an appreciation (some might say obsession) with cephalopods. Last year the OCEAN SCIENCE CREW did an intensive observation study of freely-swimming cuttlefish in an environment where they can hunt "robotic prey" (Cuttle Shuttle), and they now want to analyze the video and figure out how to apply the movement stabilization that cuttlefish achieve during tentacle shots to human space swimming techniques and space module connection protocols. The first challenge that must be solved is to define the tentacle shot pattern in a way that a computer can understand. The next challenge is to teach a computer to reliably track an animal that is evolved to actively camouflage against predators that rely on visual tracking. Once the automated tracking allows the crew to have standardized video clips of every tentacle shot recorded in the video dataset, the next challenge is to decide how to visualize, find, and interpret patterns found within these video clips. The final challenge would be to then translate the movement patterns from cuttlefish in water to human or mechanical bodies in outer space. These will be the goals of OCEAN SCIENCE CREW this year.** 

**The OCEAN SCIENCE CREW consists of Min; Joerry, also of CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE, who knows how to raise cuttlefish in capitivity and is considered the local animal husbandry expert; Zalo, from the INFRADESTRUCTORS crew, who helped build the environment and observation rig, in addition to helping program the robotic prey used to entice the cuttlefish into behaving; Atehban, from the CYBERPHILIA crew, to do the automated tracking and video dataset digestion; Ceddit, also from the INFRADESTRUCTORS crew, to translate the cuttlefish movements to the human body in order to present a report on the cuttlefish research's applicability to improving space swimming techniques (HIVE TRACKER). Rhee of the MENDELEEVERS, another first-year cadet, also joins the OCEAN SCIENCE CREW. Adi, an ISS Corps professor on the teaching staff for "Health and Well-Being in Space", is their faculty mentor.**

**Asoca becomes interested in the Cuttle Shuttle project for its applications to space modules and space architecture, and joins the OCEAN SCIENCE CREW. As Asoca and Min work together, they have many conversations expressing their philosophies about teaching and society, and realise that they share some fundamental values, even though they have different plans of action deriving from those values. They realise that they both believe in the power of education and the necessity of subversion and critical thought in a society, but Asoca believes that a wise leader can best nurture these two cultural tools, and Min believes that individuals must maintain constant vigilance against leaders using these two cultural tools. Asoca also makes a strong connection with Petros, one of the engineers coordinating the most recent batch of renovations for the Kennedy Station and a teaching assistant at Space University who specialises in space welding. Petros was a MENDELEEVER at ISS Corps who graduated 3 years ago, and was primarily responsible for adding a forge to the MENDELEEVER workspaces. Petros and Asoca bond over a shared passion for the inherent good of space exploration, even while being challenged by each other's methods of going about it: Petros believes in prioritizing the strength and longevity of space structures through a reliance on technologically enhanced inorganic materials, while Asoca believes in prioritizing the strength and longevity of the space-faring people through a reliance on sustainable life cycles for material and psychological resources.**

**As Asoca spends more time with Min, Asoca realises that Min works part-time on the service crews, in addition to everything else she does in order to be a top 10 student. She finds it unfair that Min is judged according to the same criteria as those students who are not required to dedicate half of their time to service crew duties. Asoca tries to convince Min and the other scholarship students to boycott their service crew duties, and the scholarship students reveal that the money they earn during their part-time work directly impacts the amount of financial aid given to their families. Asoca finds this exploitative, and tries to rally the other students to show solidarity with the scholarship students and demand better conditions for their scholarship. But most of the other students do not find the conditions of the scholarship so offensive, or they are unwilling to spend time on this instead of on their coursework and training, or they are so cynical that they don't think any good will come of speaking up about the terms of the scholarships. Even Min would rather "play the game well". Asoca also realises that there are no children of PROTO-VIRS amongst the scholarship students, even though some of the PROTO-VIRS children come from the same areas as some scholarship students.**

**A year has passed. In order to complete their certification, youth cadets must spend at least one year conducting scientific research and at least one year building educational exhibits showcasing this research in the context of one of their required topics for apprenticeship certification. Asoca and Min now share a joint sleeping structure, and they have formed the INTERACTIVE EXHIBITS crew, with plans to use outdated and/or recycled space shuttle/station cameras and monitors, which are deployed by advertising companies to track the visual gaze of passers-by, to build educational exhibits teaching the general public about how our brains build, adjust, break, and re-build our "internal model of the world", a topic from one of their required courses, "Health and Well-being in Space" (SURPRISING MINDS). Zalo has also joined INTERACTIVE EXHIBITS crew, along with Daru, of the CYBERPHILIA crew; and Clavel, of the MENDELEEVERS.**

**This is Min's final year with the ISS Corps. Asoca hasn't told anyone besides Min yet, but she also plans to graduate this year. Asoca has realised that the "human brain == computer" analogy destoys our ability to build trust, in each other and in our own selves, because we become conditioned to believe that learning to how to trust can be reduced to a quantifiable optimization function. Together, Asoca and Min are realising that humans cannot advance as a super-organism until we re-learn how to build trust, and we regain our evolutionary ability to spread out to where there is room and resources for us instead of being stuck in increasingly over-crowded locations because we've forgotten how to survive without our infrastructures of convenience. During this final year, they share their dreams with each other. Asoca wants to liberate the PROTO-VIRS by building space farms, and creating green spaces for growing food and natural life cycles that are out of the reach of the SPACE CONSORTIUM and any haphazard overflow of the aggressive urbanization still ravaging the Earth. Min wants to make space travel accessible to anyone but especially the now impoverished and homeless refugees from West America. She feels that refugees can have a second chance by becoming space nomads, and building homes for themselves that are safe from climate change and ignorant politicians trying to standardize procedures for populations too large and diverse to be standardized. They promise to be strong in their goals, even though they must part ways: Asoca will go to Space University, while Min has chosen to stay with the ISS Corps.**

# integrating research into the plot

- Cuttle Shuttle dataset: an obscure study from the past which inspired many aspects of current space swimming techniques. 
  - From Diogo: "Use the cuttlefish movement stabilization data not only for human swimming in space but also for space station habitats/modules connection protocols (like, a mechanical version of the tentacles used to grad and connect modules in a secure and efficient way)."
- HIVE Tracker: now a well-developed off-the-shelf "tinkering" component, like raspberry pi or arduino, used by students, hackers, etc, to track, document, and analyse movement. 
- Surprising Minds: field neuroscience is now a well-established field and considered a very important part of space exploration. The ISS Corps curriculum teaches field neuroscience and uses interactive art-science installations to fulfill science communication and public engagement requirements of their funding/it's great PR. 

The main plot will integrate the struggle between open loop causal reactive machine versus closed loop perceptual control system models of the brain. The Theoretical Puzzle Pieces, Philosophy and Ethics, and other theory stuff will get integrated into the conversations between characters, and as part of what certain characters believe. 

# ISS Corps
The ISS Corps program that Asoca and Min attend is at the Kennedy Memorial Shuttle Launch and Maintenance Station, built just south of the old ruins of the historic Kennedy Space Center. ISS Corps students are referred to as "youth cadets". The youth cadets participate in work crews to help the station staff with their duties, conduct research with a science crew to study an aspect of space travel and communication, and live with a home crew. 

During their induction week, first-year students explore and choose a "home crew". Each home crew displays their engineering and team working prowess by spending this first week hosting fun activities, meals (which are shared together with all home crews together; each home crew takes 2 meals over the course of the week to show off their collective food making prowess), and renovating their home structures to accommodate new youth cadets, based on the number of youth cadets in the crew graduated the previous year from the youth program. New youth cadets are given temporary sleeping structures for the first week, and are expected to wander from home crew to home crew, getting to know them, checking out their aesthetics and personalities, working with them, hanging out with them. New cadets usually find a home crew within the first few days and end up finishing the building of their own sleeping structures.

The Kennedy Memorial Shuttle Launch and Maintenance Station "home crews":
- CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE: They are generally preoccupied with circus and theatrical storytelling, bodily morphologies/anatomies/physiologies, and how thought and movement are connected. They like to build aquariums, terrariums, and playgrounds for humans of all sizes. Their home structures are kinetic and encourage daily training. They maintain a space swimming practice facility and a "normal gravity" dance studio/training space. 
- CYBERPHILIA: generally preoccupied with technologically-mediated communication, control, and governance. They love to tinker with robotics, AI, automated processes, and electronics. They also build wired and wireless networks, and play lots of video games (historical console/PC games, VR/AR games, simulator room games). They maintain the digital tools maker space. 
- MENDELEEVERS: generally preoccupied with the manipulation of materials, using both cutting-edge tech and simple old-fashioned methods. They combine techniques from chemistry, physics, and traditional hand crafts to build both beautiful and practical art and devices. They like to play "what if...in space?", in which a situation is invented in which something breaks out in space, and no internet is available, and very few technologically optimized tools are available, and thus one must macgyver a solution using un-networked tools. They maintain the machine shop, fabrication labs, and workspaces for traditional hand crafts. 
- INFRADESTRUCTORS: preoccupied with understanding the basic facilities, services, and installations needed for the healthy functioning of a society or organization, and with "un-black-boxing" these facilities, services, and installations (meaning that they want to know how things like plumbing, electricity, sewage systems, etc work, and then they want to modify these systems and document these systems well enough that other people can play/hack with them). They liase with the station management team and maintain the utilities shared by the home crews. 

Home crews are unique to each ISS Corps station, and have their own history, culture, and traditions. There is no need to separately house cadets based on their reproductive organs, as, according to government regulations, any sperm- or egg-production capabilities are neutralized in all children until they earn a Reproductive License, and upon arrival at the ISS Corps station, all cadets undergo a medical examination, which includes a sexual health battery. 

To help the cadets plan their science exploration projects, the next 2 weeks after induction week everyone gets a refresher course on the history and mission of the ISS Corps (it's meant to be taught by different lecturers each year, to give different perspectives on the history and highlight different details based on the lecturer's focus/interests). The mission of the ISS Corps is to ensure a mutually benefitial exchange of knowledge and resources between Earth and Space. This mission includes providing a "unique learning experience to the youth of our planetary community", in order to keep the knowledge and wisdom of this endeavor alive for future generations.

Because the ISS Corps is open to any pre-university youth over the age of 16, the ISS Corps students tend to be between 16 and 18 years old. Students are designated as 1st, 2nd, or 3rd years based on how many years they've attended ISS Corps, not based on their age. In addition, those who stay with the ISS Corps for vocational training tend to maintain close connections with their old home crews, and often stop by for a chat, a meal, or some other social event. 

ISS Corps is quite competitive -- less than 15% of applicants are accepted into the program. It also has a reputation for about 25% of the first-years dropping out because they can't handle some aspect of life in the ISS Corps, which is very socially intense and intellectually challenging. In addition, in order to come back for a 2nd or 3rd year, 1st year cadets must be recommended by their home crews. 

3 years is the maximum length of time that a student may remain in the ISS Corps. After that, they are expected to have completed their apprenticeship certifications; some complete their certifications in 2 years, very rarely does anyone complete their certification in 1 year. Most ISS Corps graduates go on to attend Space University, which has now been relocated to its own geosynchronous space station. A significant minority stay with the ISS Corps to complete their 4-year vocational training, which can stand in place of a university degree but is much more specialised and not considered quite as prestigious. 

During the first six months of ISS Corps, first-year cadets learn about the life cycles of material resources on an ISS Corps maintenance station, in addition to the following 4 required topics for certification: History of the ISS and the Space Shuttle program, Health and Well-being in Space, Space Policy and Regulations, and Basic electronics and machine shop training. Everyone must also pick one more course from the following offerings: Exo-farming, Exo-architecture, and Design and Construction of Space Shuttles. Asoca chose Exo-architecture, Min chose Design and Construction of Space Shuttles. 

# GREAT NORTH AMERICAN WAR OF 2047

## West America, New Texas, Appalachia, and New England

# background vomit

Soca's home is idyllic and protected, but then she leaves it to go to the ISS Corps and through her eyes we see the more grim aspects of her reality. She hasn't spent much time outside her home village, but she has visited the nearby city and has seen how differently other people live from herself and her village. 

Soca has to go from wanting to build glorified tree houses to becoming benevolent dictator of the human intergalactic empire. There's a turning point in there, and I kind of see it happening when she meets Min at ISS Corps. There they "corrupt" each other, because min realises that you need the benevolent dictator to drastically push society in a new direction, and soca realises that when benevolent dictators die, very careful plans must be made, and lots of robustness built into those plans, to keep that new direction going. and the new direction we want is respectful, healthy, mature anarchy, where we take advantage of our evolutionary power to distribute well: distribute ourselves through many environments, distribute tasks when solving problems together, distribute resources to stay connected between our distributed locations, etc. 

so the idea i had was that soca starts to work in space hydroponics and becomes very influential because she's feeding everyone, and once climate change and wars on earth start really fucking up food supplies and chains, humanity starts relying more and more on space farms. corrupt leaders on Earth try to manipulate people using food as leverage, and soca says, fuck that, here's food with no strings attached. 

soca also needs to develop iron will in order to become a benevolent dictator. I think that comes from her mother. 

I think Min should already be at the ISS Corps by the time Soca arrives.
