# new context

Set in the very near future of our reality. Some political setup set about 50 years in the future: after Trump, USA rejoins Paris Climate accord and many efforts to stem the effects of climate change seem to be working. Education crisis is at a head, cities are overcrowded, and rural communities are dying. But we've made it to Mars, and we've established a research base on the planet. There's a lot of talk in the news about exciting developments in agricultural science that will improve exo-hydroponics (plants useful for space travel) and permaculture on the Mars research base. The needs of the Mars mission have revitalized funding and interest in the ISS, which in turn has resurrected the Space Shuttles idea. Many of the scientists and engineers who once worked with Elon Musk and SpaceX have gone on to establish space exploration companies and consortiums all over the world. 

Some of these folks have developed an interest in education, in order to sustain interest in space exploration into the next generation, and to find the best and the brightest for their projects. This is especially appropriate, as education has become a complete extension of the marketplace. Students obsessively and aggressively compete to complete the pre-university checklist of CV items. Topics of study are only considered valuable if they lead to well-paying jobs. 

To groom more youth to work in space exploration industries, these ex-SpaceX people create a training program for international youth called the ISS Corps, where youth learn to design, build, and maintain space shuttles that can carry humans, equipment, and other resources to the ISS and return to Earth. The ISS is now an important way-station for maintaining communication and supply chains to Mars. The ISS Corps is affiliated with the Space University, and quickly becomes popular amongst the well-educated elite of the world. 

Climate change and wars on Earth are still creating refugee populations everywhere. The founders of the ISS Corps convince the UN to implement a refugee re-education process that gives young refugees the option of joining the ISS Corps in an apprenticeship arrangement that allows them to take part in the ISS Corps as scholarship students, in exchange for working on the service crews at planetside stations. This is seen as a politically suave move, something to increase the diversity of the ISS Corps student body and increase the appeal of the ISS Corps mission as a global endeavor, it's great PR. 

Mini has joined the ISS Corps in this way. Her family was part of the well-educated elite of a city somewhere that is now fallen to civil war thanks to a massive food shortage due to drought. She is pragmatic about her situation, but still carries herself with pride. There is tension between the refugee youth who join the ISS Corps as scholarship students, versus the non-scholarship students, who often come from very affluent families in parts of the world that have managed to keep the grim realities of climate change at bay for one reason or another. The scholarship students must work as janitors, cafeteria staff, etc. in the ISS Corps facilities, so they see a sharp divide between how service industry staff are treated versus administrative, research, and engineering staff. 

Soca is a non-scholarship student, coming from a small but well-to-do rural town, in an area of the world that has yet to feel the horrible consequences of global warming. She is very driven and studious, but has had an easy life. 

# integrating research into the plot

- Cuttle Shuttle dataset: an obscure study from the past which inspired many aspects of current space swimming techniques. 
- HIVE Tracker: now a well-developed off-the-shelf "tinkering" component, like raspberry pi or arduino, used by students, hackers, etc, to track, document, and analyse movement. 
- Surprising Minds: field neuroscience is now a well-established field and considered a very important part of space exploration. The ISS Corps curriculum teaches field neuroscience and uses interactive art-science installations to fulfill science communication and public engagement requirements of their funding/it's great PR. 

The main plot will integrate/be a showcase of the struggle between open loop causal reactive machine versus closed loop perceptual control system models of the brain. The Theoretical Puzzle Pieces, Philosophy and Ethics, and other theory stuff will get integrated into the conversations between characters, and as part of what certain characters believe. 

# plot vomit

Story follows both Soca and Min, separately as they prepare to go to the ISS Corps. 

## Soca
Her home is idyllic and protected, but then she leaves it to go to the ISS Corps and through her eyes we see the more grim aspects of her reality.
