        <title>Chapter 1</title>
        <p id="heading-4212ebc9ded16948c90bd63db7cac6fc" level="3">Min is undergoing her medical clearance exam for the ISS Corps, at the hospital in New Orleans where she and her parents have been staying as refugees for the last year. She's stressed - after a rigorous and exclusive application process, Min was rewarded a scholarship from <bold id="bold-e473969df87c3b319512e673051eb94c">SPACE CONSORTIUM</bold>, which is the only way that she would be able to afford the ISS Corps, but now there is this medical clearance exam. Min nervously scratches her head tatoo, which marks her as part of <bold id="bold-53cc988945addba32e13479c401a1b26">FAMILY GANG</bold>, led by Min's grandmother. It's a bit red and puffy - it goes through these cycles, ever since round about when her puberty started and she was given a <bold id="bold-1a911223ac31faaa97d8eca3fead75db">REPRODUCTIVE REPRESSOR</bold>, her head tatoo would occassionally get red and puffy, though not itchy or painful - but now Min is worried that it looks infected or dangerous and thus the head tatoo might disqualify her for ISS Corps.</p>
        <p id="p-178f1a997ec44c67ca5f67e31d0f9e69" level="3">After a standard checkup, the nurse finds that her head tatoo was slightly contaminated with <bold id="bold-c597d797f7cdea77e2589704312e781f">ESYRUP</bold>. It's not enough for it to self-assemble and gain emergent properties, and it's rather unusual that the <bold id="bold-e2199677bdafeaab9d32866e2b6bd59e">ESYRUP </bold>seems to be several years old but is still viable. The nurse gives Min a pill "to help label the <bold id="bold-140535adfb0b4e62e2fe77987b916645">ESYRUP</bold>", then scans Min's head tatoo. He then gives Min some pills that will "neutralize the side effects of <bold id="bold-fc621a695257bb1c0b3e44e917e2759b">ESYRUP </bold>contamination", then signs off on her health check.</p>
        <p id="p-2">Min says goodbye to her family and mates, who are all gathered in the room where Min's mom is being treated for cancer. Min's mom was diagnosed just before a raging fire destroyed their neighborhood in Mississippi, forcing them to come to New Orleans. Min's grandmother has some old friends and contacts in New Orleans who helped them get bumped up in the waiting list for hospital treatment. </p>
        <p id="p-663d25c42c7b40963c2c72038e6d789b">Min's grandmother has a mission for Min, but Min isn't sure if she wants to be a <bold id="bold-03c0ad003667bcc208b832c4734fce64">GANGIE </bold>for life. Min's grandmother scolds her for disparaging the traditions and practices of a way of life that nutured and raised her. Min's mother steps in and confesses that she also didn't want to be a <bold id="bold-ed1abc516e8d3219548b4a9ee2ccb043">GANGIE </bold>for life, and that she raised Min with the dream of understanding the world with uncluttered eyes, and that's why Min is going to the ISS Corps, on a scholarship. Min can choose to carry out Grandmother's mission or not, and Min's mother will stand by her. Grandmother sighs - Min's mother had always been very independent and strong willed - and concedes. </p>

        <p id="heading-d8876e8e2c01350f18933943429cc6cf" level="2">Min boards a space shuttle for the first time, even though she's spent her whole life seeing the ponderous metal vehicles burn the atmosphere daily with their entries and exits. On board she meets other successful applicants to this year's ISS Corps cadet cohort, but there are nervous whispers of the high rate of drop-outs during the first year: 48% last year. The space shuttle automatic PA system announces a "health and safety during space travel" speech in a chirpy voice as they prepare to exit the atmosphere. Everyone is given barf bags. The shuttle exits the atmosphere, and the cadets who had never been in space before, many of them get super naseous, including Min. </p>
        <p id="p-d0af55a957ea006b85dca8f77442fc6b" level="2">The PA announces that their remote pilot will be switching them to auto-pilot at this point, and that this shuttle's rendezvous with <bold id="bold-2f2978e8848a9282f198cdfea18f0662">GEMINI</bold>, the ISS Corps geosyncronous station, was expected in 3 hours. With a click, the PA system switched over to playing soft, pre-water-crisis progressive rock. </p>
        <p id="p-76caaf6db1b9753a9ccca951eff7c700" level="2">Suddenly the front end of the shuttle bursts open - apparently there are more passenger compartments! A group of cadets wearing the body piercings indicative of <bold id="bold-22cfd2df994d3a41643cd5ab33d80749">GLOBAL MONASTIC CULT </bold>enter, accompanied by their <bold id="bold-c6dc37e13b886eb26723b316bd0adc65">ESYRUP DAEMONS</bold>. Min realises that everyone in her compartment were either <bold id="bold-de75e0a00d3ee6964156e33171c1372c">NORMIES </bold>("mod-virgins") or <bold id="bold-ccd8239875fe809040f4a9a7ca741080">GANGIES </bold>("head tats"). <bold id="bold-7a1c67a2835f83759701a766d2530fc7">GANGIES</bold>' head tatoos are made from normal ink but designed like QR codes - they contain encrypted information for Augmented Vision, which many city people have. Only the very rich and powerful have <bold id="bold-a1c06c352c9e3f64147bda09b32c803d">ESYRUP </bold>tatoos, which basically turn them into cyborgs, humans who have incorporated their personal electronic computing capabilities directly into their bodies. </p>
        <p id="p-2d821b1ae6b7c0bb71b8919cbf04cd41" level="2">The group of <bold id="bold-f2454c8b81b88cfdfd39157559b884c3">GLOBAL MONASTIC CULT </bold>cadets that just entered help the naseous cadets in Min's compartment, and let them know that the shuttle has a cafe compartment with snacks and drinks where other cadets were hanging out for the 6 hours ahead. Everyone heads to the cafe compartment. Min meets more other cadets. Rhee, a <bold id="bold-0c791ea772dcc0526c4c27edbcaa4f44">NORMIE </bold>cadet, gets sick all over Rajue, a haughty cadet with <bold id="bold-33980be66fce088f17da1080323fab23">ESYRUP </bold>tatoos. Rajue is furious and starts verbally abusing Rhee, who is still trying to keep her stomach under control. Min reacts to his unreasonable reaction and steps in to tell Rajue to lay off, but then he turns his anger to Min instead. Min, who grew up in tough urban neighborhoods and was a bit hotheaded herself, got in his face, and things started getting physically violent.</p>
        <p id="p-67f7392872dde2c26384fe4f4f46bf1c" level="2">Asoka, a <bold id="bold-61c239ff8c4d7b558f346d429c249a44">GLOBAL MONASTIC CULT </bold>cadet, steps in and tells them both to calm down. Asoka's <bold id="bold-b38ba567d6299b389e7142e0d96ea703">ESYRUP DAEMON</bold>, an oversized flamboyant cuttlefish named <bold id="bold-27b9878185e926ffade46ff807c28a33">IRI</bold>, cradles the sick Rhee while Asoka faces Rajue, who decides to escalate and injects himself with <bold id="bold-681a3ab0fc8724f8038796e5330170a0">WHAMO!</bold>, a popular "mood enhancer" made of adrenaline and instant muscle toner. Asoka uses her capoeira skills to easily pin and subdue Rajue. She tells everyone that she, <bold id="bold-7e0d3d63d347bc3a02b3a5927a7991d3">IRI</bold>, and Min were going to leave with Rhee to help her feel better for the rest of the journey, and Rajue was going to stay in the cafe compartment and behave himself. Rajue brushes himself off and huffily disappears into the crowd of cadets. </p>

        <p id="heading-fd32f47dabcc67c636e23b2a1c962bee" level="2">Min and Asoka help Rhee back to her compartment, where Rhee digs through her bags for an anti-nausea pill. Rhee insists that she's fine, she just needs some quiet and good grief, what she'd do for some sparkling water. Min reveals that she'd nicked a couple bottles of sparkling water from the cafe. The girls open bottles of fizzy water over toasts to their newly forged friendship. They end up sharing how they each came to be part of the ISS Corps cohort for that year. </p>
        <p id="p-5acfb6f214a4d7fee8c067c3f2c5c061" level="2">As they approach the <bold id="bold-2d4d43fee9bacc3e363cc04eaae76539">GEMINI</bold>, all three of them marvel at its design. The final part of the journey takes them on a slow drift over the station as the shuttle matches its velocity with the station. </p>

        <p id="heading-4cb12550b3bd34acb720d10b791263c4" level="2">The shuttle finally docks with <bold id="bold-f1dc52749b342e2eab0c9cb6e4934ba3">GEMINI </bold>station, as the PA system announces that all cadets must check their entry documents for their crew assignments. Asoka is assigned to <bold id="bold-bb8cd6bdc8f3563988d09ed3d796531e">CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE</bold>, Rhee to <bold id="bold-7f4ef5cf0157322e400b88fb59116a80">MENDELEEVERS</bold>. Min looks for her crew but finds "Undecided" on her documents. PA system calls, "If you are an Undecided, please report to Docking Bay Door 0813." Asoka, Rhee, and Min promise to find each other later. They step out into the docking bay to see the whole school lined up, rank and file, ready to greet the newcomers. "Welcome, muskies!" they roar in unison, as they snap into the ISS Corps cadet salute. "Muskies?" "It's because you all smell of Earth still!"</p>
        <p id="p-91520ae5762b019cb83f5ab2030ccc61" level="2">Min reports to Docking Bay Door 0813 and finds a small group of cadets. She is greeted by third-year cadets Zalo, of the <bold id="bold-e9e90e22bea05ae55ecfc46b855fe3bd">INFRADESTRUCTORS </bold>crew, and Jheri, of the <bold id="bold-61401599af12c382522b1c26be300868">CYBERPHILIA </bold>crew. They both volunteered to show around the Undecideds, which places their crews at the front of the line for who gets to host Undecideds first. </p>
        <p id="p-aaa7573d1a0be665452fabe08ced9021" level="2">Zalo and Jheri explain that the <bold id="bold-95672f9a7ee8dac0f0cfe90d7c7be4d0">SCHOOL SORTING ALGORITHM</bold> didn't have enough data on Undecided cadets, which is why they didn't have a crew yet. They would spend the next week getting to know each of the home crews and would need to pick a homecrew by the end of the week. Day 1 would be with <bold id="bold-2407921e0929581cf944d5af3d9e4385">INFRADESTRUCTORS</bold>, Day 2 with <bold id="bold-3b7cff235730d8494af54a6bae00ef6c">CYBERPHILIA</bold>, Day 3 with <bold id="bold-5ce8a18d90b3159787b604b55d3a8292">CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE</bold>, and Day 4 with <bold id="bold-b55a642097c426cf7941afa85fc0e3d5">MENDELEEVERS</bold>. Day 5 and 6 would be with the home crew of their own choosing, and could be different for each day. On Day 7 they would submit a ranked list of all 4 crews, listed from most preferred to least preferred crew. Each home crew also submits a list of all Undecideds, ranked according to how much they would like to have an Undecided join their crew. Reps from each home crew meet with these lists and negotiate, until everyone has no worse than their second choice. </p>
        <p id="p-4f602d6c92b0cd0cc453db6e1d0da748" level="2">Zalo then shows the cadets a day in the life of the <bold id="bold-30ffeca88c90fd6a3446f176f37bf619">INFRADESTRUCTORS </bold>crew. They are taking apart a <bold id="bold-5df771b91a35b0041042c36b6695d8fc">POCKET SCANNER</bold>, a "universal scanning" device that can obtain measurements of the electromagnetic, acoustic, and material properties of non-living objects. Min bonds with many here over the democratization of tech and the social implications of letting <bold id="bold-6a18356fbc6ad657d2794ba224af78d7">ESYRUP</bold>, which is so prevalent and used by so many, remain a proprietary substance, even though when it was originally made the recipe was open source. </p>
        <p id="p-29e98aa8fee690a62bd8c5dd6175cea7" level="2">Afterwards, Min reports to the <bold id="bold-a0c9262c067a8e154d49bfdd416c2443">HEAD OF SERVICE CREW</bold>, who turns out to be a <bold id="bold-e9e2c4732a278bc5dc402c51280e11cf">GANGIE</bold> named <bold id="bold-69ca5cd551fe852c87c2c566f08b8695">PQ</bold>. They instantaneously bond - Min's grandmother once helped <bold id="bold-bbcecfb89c6654fb380f8d705c84f69b">PQ</bold>'s mother with a really important project, and they've been tight as thieves ever since: "Any grandchild of that woman is a friend of mine!" <bold id="bold-c6f04b7dd4110421ec608c3f953569a7">PQ </bold>reassures Min that if she's ever feeling overwhelmed by her schoolwork, <bold id="bold-3927bf48744ffedabf268c0b25ba98ec">PQ </bold>will put Min on a security desk shift, so that she can do schoolwork during her service crew shifts, which are required by the terms of her scholarship from <bold id="bold-a62601d2d2779528da06e32ed6187143">SPACE CONSORTIUM</bold>. </p>

        <p id="heading-195d8ef92df1877bf1a53f0c5b7060ad" level="2">Jheri shows the cadets a day in the life of the <bold id="bold-0f596afed114bca3b5a7b80da2ea4538">CYBERPHILIA </bold>crew. Min bonds with many on this crew over a shared love of anime, live improvisational music, and <bold id="bold-1e4fd026e0e2a075c23ef10535a60fcf">ESYRUP DAEMONS</bold>, as many <bold id="bold-2caa2192437b8a54f685149bc6dc4f82">GLOBAL MONASTIC CULT </bold>members tend to end up in this crew. Many cadets with <bold id="bold-c0bc12ccb00010bd6211e78e84252fb1">ESYRUP </bold>tatoos also end up in the <bold id="bold-a2c3fe8070ec1076fc95eec235fc2bdd">CYBERPHILIA </bold>crew, but they tend to keep to themselves. Zalo also spends a good portion of the day with them, which Min assumes is because he is one of their cadet mentors. But then she remembers that Jheri wasn't around yesterday, hmm. </p>
        <p id="p-a968d32c1c4dfad13890bb6de536e306" level="2">Jheri teaches the cadets how to use the laser atomic manipulator, which allows them to perform surgeries so precise that they can cut out a 1cm cubed volume out from deep inside of a living animal without causing bleeding or needing stitches. </p>
        <p id="p-a34242edb7c6bc645b71041bbdad53d9" level="2">The next day the Undecideds are dropped off at <bold id="bold-3a02605ead845bfb2ddde7284c9f2426">CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE</bold>, where 3rd-year cadet <bold id="bold-8db012260c69273d067c7f30e81b9070">GIAMO </bold>is leading the day's physical training. After a morning of rigorous drills, they break for water and fruit before they play games on the physical structures the crew builds for themselves, a combination of capoeira, parkour, and Okinawan Kobudō. By lunch Min is exhausted but exhilerated. She finds Asoka at lunch and they catch up. In the afternoon, Asoka brings Min to her "Animal Husbandry in Space" course, where teacher <bold id="bold-4df02d8f8dc2b57db7a86330882689c9">ADI</bold>, who will teach "Health and Well-being in Space" during the semester, entertains them with stories of research animals on space vessels escaping their designated areas. After the lecture they watch <bold id="bold-01e1fd89ebf8d4490734586c0983d18b">IRI </bold>play with biological cephalopods in the aquaculture tanks, and Asoka shares everything she knows about cuttlefish with Min.  </p>

Tross's <bold id="bold-6484e09618e6d9db0acecedf4140c72f">ESYRUP DAEMON</bold>, a midnight black, silky and sinewy cat named <bold id="bold-e83ee50a2af14d1be76e6890ed9e37c3">INQBI</bold>, who could alternate between curling around Tross's shoulders like an adorable, purring scarf, to gliding through night and shadows like a silent, hazel-eyed wave of death and destruction. Min finds Tross's teaching style incredibly exciting and asks such eager questions that Tross and Min continue chatting over lunch, where Min also finds Rhee. Min and Rhee become fast friends with <bold id="bold-c95e7b1177c22260efc078f07110be38">INQBI</bold>, who shares their fondness for fried cheese. </p>
        <p id="p-6140bfbc8f5d0cd6f5b3261c330ecfed" level="2">After lunch, Rhee introduces Min to Oana, another <bold id="bold-128ab2d6d4e1c43783979b5a7b0f8d07">NORMIE </bold>who nevertheless has become an expert at blowing microscopic bio-compatible <bold id="bold-0d6e4182deef045c3d47188a349916c3">ESYRUP</bold>-infused glass filaments, which can be gently embedded subdermally to create programmable, interactive "mod-makeup". Oana shows them how to verify each piece to certify it safe for subdermal injection. While they work, Rhee teases Min for her fascination with Tross. Oana reveals that Tross was a muskie during the same year as she and Zalo and Jheri, but he is the first and only cadet to graduate in one year - most students take the full 3, and occassionally someone graduates in 2 years. Tross is now a 2nd-year journeyhume at Space University as an independent space welder, but he returns to the ISS Corps for the first week of the year, to be part of the initiation week and hold workshops and demonstrations for the <bold id="bold-2dce4281f5a37f55983fcd360b7b2301">MENDELEEVERS</bold>.  </p>
        <p id="p-5025dde691ba11532a6a7cc236e25ded" level="2">On Day 5, Min decides to go back to the <bold id="bold-50789e7bed06ea74ead13f6e2e031e84">MENDELEEVERS</bold>. She spends the morning unsuccessfully searching for Tross while learning how to bake sourdough bread in space. After lunch, she wanders until she spies <bold id="bold-2cf776dbfbbebc62007a143a6eb619a4">INQBI </bold>disappearing around a corner. She steps into a workroom where she runs into Tross, who grabs her by the shoulders and makes her look at him and not the workroom behind him. He tries to encourage her to leave, but Min thinks it's a joke and tries to playfully fight her way past him. He doesn't let her go though, and their grappling becomes more earnest. Tross grips Min, too hard, she cries out in pain, and says, deadly serious, "Min, if you value your life, turn around and walk out of the room right now." Utterly shaken, Min flees. </p>

She had slept in Asoka's sleeping structure the night before, she was so confused and frightened by Tross's behaviour. She and Asoka had discussed it until late into the night, and now, the next day, she just wants to shut up the questions in her head with blindingly difficult physical challenges, so she and Asoka work on space swimming drills until they reach lunch time, exhausted. Everyone is super excited by how quickly Min's space swimming is improving, especially Asoka, who has been training space swimming since childhood and has been looking for another skilled swimmer to help with her experiments in multi-partner synchronized space swimming, which could be a new way to accomplish certain build and maintenance tasks for space vessels. </p>
        <p id="p-458e343014699671ac07ab3f5addfc82" level="2">In the afternoon, while studying an old philosophical play about Rosalind Franklin, Zalo and Jheri come to find Min. He asks her if she feels able to make a ranked list of home crews, and which crew she feels the most connection with. Min is horribly torn, she loves every crew for different reasons! She goes on to Zalo about the things she loves about each crew and what she feels she could learn from all of them. Zalo and Jheri exchange a look. They sternly tell her to study her feelings more closely and come to a decision, as she will not be allowed to learn craft/trade secrets outside her home crew's career class qualifications. Zalo, oddly formal, shakes her hand as he and Jheri leave to find the next Undecided. Min realises he is slipping her a note, as he says, darkly suggestive, "If you're still torn by midnight tonight...there might be extra office hours." </p>
        <p id="p-40868d3e54942438aeb086d83387d45f" level="2">Min waits to go to the toilet before looking at the note, which contained a cryptic message. Min spends the rest of the day decoding it, in the end recruiting Asoka and Rhee to help her. It's a location, and a passcode. Rhee thinks it's a bad idea, maybe a nasty prank, and doesn't want Min to go. Asoka is terribly curious, and wants Min to go. Min decides she wants to at least know what sort of help is being offered, and decides to go. </p>
        <p id="p-296287830b62ab0a67cba818748f2387" level="2">When Min arrives at the secret location, she is greeted by two masked cadets, who coldly ask if she came alone, then scan her with <bold id="bold-b998109ba17465d7899599224c8d40bc">POCKET SCANNERS</bold>. The two masked cadets then turn on a <bold id="bold-f4dfb2074954e7aac720cacb323b1270">SIGNAL SCRAMBLER</bold> and informs Min that they can help her with her upcoming decision, but she has a government tracer in nervous system, one that harvest biomarker data from her and sends it to an untraceable location. The masked cadets tell Min that if she wants help with her decision, she needs to get the tracer removed. Min is appalled that her bio-data has been harvested for the last week without her permission, but she's scared - won't whoever put this in her come after her if they see that the tracer isn't sending sensible data anymore? Also, how could she trust masked strangers to perform what would amount to an illegal surgery on her? "Please," says one of the masked cadets, "trust us, you need to remove this tracer. It can collect stressful or suggestive mind states, save the parameters, and artificially re-trigger that mindset in you, even remotely."</p>
        <p id="p-2b25838de93aeeca120eacf8d72cafca" level="2">Min is growing increasingly frightened, and the masked cadets increasingly frustrated. Finally, they take off their masks - it's Jheri and Zalo. Jheri says, "Look, I'm the best at this kind of surgery, even if I'm still not even a Journeyhume. Please let me take this tracer out of you." Min agrees, realising that she trusts these two deeply. </p>
        <p id="p-96eb127f6155a5d56b0b052d28f858ac" level="2">After the surgery, Jhery and Zalo walk Min through a maze of interstitial spaces on <bold id="bold-69ae10f1baab62aaea5ae6afeea51366">GEMINI</bold> to get to another secret room, where <bold id="bold-73140fd88898d90888be3108858ef647">ADI</bold>, Tross, Oana, <bold id="bold-cfbe87d805c80432551dd8f423d40b34">GIAMO</bold>, and a few others are gathered. Zalo reveals that these are members of a secret society here at the ISS Corps, who are trying to reverse engineer the formula for making ESYRUP, and who have realised that they need skills and expertise from across the different home crews. </p>
