        <title>Chapter 1</title>
        <p id="heading-4212ebc9ded16948c90bd63db7cac6fc" level="3">Min, a <bold id="bold-54124b49e7111d5b8b80e2bed8aca5ee">GANGIE </bold>from Mississippi, is undergoing her medical clearance exam for the ISS Corps, at the hospital in New Orleans where she and her parents have been staying as refugees for the last year. She's stressed - after a rigorous and long application process, Min was rewarded a scholarship from <bold id="bold-e473969df87c3b319512e673051eb94c">SPACE CONSORTIUM</bold>, which is the only way that she would be able to afford the ISS Corps, but now there is this medical clearance exam. Min nervously scratches her head tatoo, which marks her as part of <bold id="bold-53cc988945addba32e13479c401a1b26">FAMILY GANG</bold>, led by Min's grandmother, Mago. It's a bit red and puffy - it goes through these cycles, ever since her puberty started and she was given a <bold id="bold-1a911223ac31faaa97d8eca3fead75db">REPRODUCTIVE REPRESSOR</bold>, her head tatoo would occassionally get red and puffy, though not itchy or painful - but now Min is worried that it looks infected or dangerous and thus the head tatoo might disqualify her for ISS Corps.</p>
        <p id="p-178f1a997ec44c67ca5f67e31d0f9e69" level="3">After a standard checkup, the nurse finds that her head tatoo was slightly contaminated with <bold id="bold-c597d797f7cdea77e2589704312e781f">ESYRUP</bold>. It's rather unusual that the <bold id="bold-e2199677bdafeaab9d32866e2b6bd59e">ESYRUP </bold>seems to be several years old but is still viable. The nurse gives Min a pill "to help label the <bold id="bold-140535adfb0b4e62e2fe77987b916645">ESYRUP</bold>", then scans Min's head tatoo. He then gives Min some pills that will "neutralize the side effects of <bold id="bold-fc621a695257bb1c0b3e44e917e2759b">ESYRUP </bold>contamination", then signs off on Min's health check.</p>
        <p id="p-2">Min says goodbye to her family and mates, who are all gathered in another hospical room. Grandma Mago tells Min how proud she is that Min will be going to an engineering institution. She expects Min to carry on the mathematical traditions of their family - both Mago and Jina are mathematicians. Mago runs casinos along the flooded Mississippi River, and Jina developed a new branch of ansible mathematics when she turned a childhood hobby of cracking ansible transmissions from space shuttle control towers into an impressive Universal Certification Dissertation on "The theory of calculating the distance and direction of non-Large-Mass-Body ansibles in encrypted interstellar communications". Mago exclaims how she can't wait for Min to come back a Space University certified mathematician, and work for the <bold id="bold-0e27dcaad5304df6ca69a2586cc42baf">FAMILY GANG</bold> after repaying her debt to <bold id="bold-b84032b6fc8886f24cc964e1958dd4d8">SPACE CONSORTIUM</bold>. </p>
        <p id="p-a19820e100cd54eb524d4da8a4451584">Min doesn't tell Grandma Mago, but she doesn't plan to study mathematics at the ISS Corps at all. She wants to get Universal Certification in space swimming and change her career classification to space crafter, anything that will get her regular access to space shuttles. Min thanks everyone for their well wishes and extracts herself to a smaller room down the hall, where Min's dad sits Sung-Soo is reading to Jina, Min's mom, who is being treated for cancer. Jina was diagnosed just before a raging fire destroyed their neighborhood in Mississippi, forcing them to come to New Orleans. Grandma Mago has some old friends and contacts in New Orleans who helped them get bumped up in the waiting list for hospital treatment. </p>
        <p id="p-1374709ccbb24151e63dc6ddbb90943b">Sung-soo and Jina greet Min warmly. They ask if Min has told Grandma Mago of her new study plans. Min hasn't - she doesn't want to disappoint Grandma Mago, and she's a little scared of Grandma. Jina smiles understandingly, and reminds Min that she and Sung-soo support Min's right to choose her path at this point, pointing out that when Jina decided to study ansible mathematics, Grandma Mago was also concerned about the relevance of this newfangled tech for supporting the family and their way of life. Sung-soo reminds Min that we may never know beforehand what will benefit us in the future, so if someone is super excited about a direction, they should walk that direction with strong purpose and confident imagination. Both of Min's parents express their love for Min, and when she's ready to tell Grandma, they will support her. </p>

        <title>Chapter 2</title>
        <p id="heading-d8876e8e2c01350f18933943429cc6cf" level="2">Min boards a space shuttle for the first time, even though she's spent her whole life seeing the ponderous, enormous vehicles draw condensation traces in the atmosphere daily with their entries and exits. On board she meets other successful applicants to this year's ISS Corps cadet cohort, but there are nervous whispers of the high rate of drop-outs during the first year: 48% last year. The space shuttle automatic PA system announces a "health and safety during space travel" speech in a chirpy voice as they prepare to exit the atmosphere. Everyone is given barf bags. The shuttle exits the atmosphere, and many of the cadets who had never been in space before get super naseous, including Min. </p>
        <p id="p-d0af55a957ea006b85dca8f77442fc6b" level="2">The PA announces that their remote pilot will be switching them to auto-pilot at this point, and that this shuttle's rendezvous with <bold id="bold-2f2978e8848a9282f198cdfea18f0662">GEMINI</bold>, the ISS Corps geosyncronous station, was expected in 3 hours. With a click, the PA system switches over to playing soft, pre-Water-Crisis jazz, heavily flavoured with hip hop, funk, and Balinese Gamelan influences - rather genreless, as much of the music from the Final Era of Art tended to be. </p>
        <p id="p-76caaf6db1b9753a9ccca951eff7c700" level="2">Suddenly the front end of the shuttle bursts open - apparently there are more passenger compartments! A group of cadets wearing the body piercings indicative of <bold id="bold-22cfd2df994d3a41643cd5ab33d80749">GLOBAL MONASTIC CULT </bold>enter, accompanied by their <bold id="bold-c6dc37e13b886eb26723b316bd0adc65">ESYRUP DAEMONS</bold>. Min realises that everyone in her compartment were either <bold id="bold-de75e0a00d3ee6964156e33171c1372c">NORMIES </bold>("mod-virgins") or <bold id="bold-ccd8239875fe809040f4a9a7ca741080">GANGIES </bold>("head tats"). <bold id="bold-7a1c67a2835f83759701a766d2530fc7">GANGIES</bold>' head tatoos are made from normal ink but designed like QR codes - they contain encrypted information for Augmented Vision, which many people now have thanks to <bold id="bold-5b228b8e5fca8f678479e264e89c03df">ESYRUP SPLICING</bold>. But only the very rich and powerful have <bold id="bold-a1c06c352c9e3f64147bda09b32c803d">ESYRUP </bold>tatoos, subdermally injected bio-compatible silicon material on their skulls and along major nerves, which basically turn them into cyborgs, humans who have incorporated their personal electronic computing capabilities directly into their nervous systems. </p>
        <p id="p-a2b3854a0ac4ab1db1ff80c01f255cd0" level="2">But like all post-Water-Crisis <bold id="bold-965a69e973532e8ca124089af3292b6f">ESYRUP</bold>, these tatoos were not actually alive in the same sense as the biology with which they are so compatible. These days you can only get "harvested <bold id="bold-12fd9ee42161e3541d86081434d02c35">ESYRUP</bold>", which can be injected into and calibrated to a biological partner once for best effects. The second morph tended to be slower and stiffer, and usually by the third morph that <bold id="bold-2a80e0965b4b7ed4deb7cce855d4cf5d">ESYRUP </bold>has had its last reconfiguration. Everyone knows that someone somewhere must be using a live culture of <bold id="bold-57a1fb9f808ba2f89f8491172191436f">ESYRUP</bold> to generate huge quantities of "harvested" or "dead" <bold id="bold-ab87822f9f320ff96201678225b5060f">ESYRUP</bold>, because <bold id="bold-5c639a6ed156e8c4e6f3341260979297">ESYRUP </bold>is cheap and readily accessible, but the formula for creating a live culture then how to keep it alive and healthy have been lost or obscured. </p>
        <p id="p-2d821b1ae6b7c0bb71b8919cbf04cd41" level="2">The group of <bold id="bold-f2454c8b81b88cfdfd39157559b884c3">GLOBAL MONASTIC CULT </bold>cadets that just entered help the naseous cadets in Min's compartment, and let them know that the shuttle has a cafe compartment with snacks and drinks where other cadets were hanging out for the 3 hours ahead. Everyone heads to the cafe compartment. Min meets more other cadets. Rhee, a <bold id="bold-0c791ea772dcc0526c4c27edbcaa4f44">NORMIE </bold>cadet, gets sick all over Rajue, a haughty cadet with <bold id="bold-33980be66fce088f17da1080323fab23">ESYRUP </bold>tatoos. Rajue is furious and starts verbally abusing Rhee, who is still trying to keep her stomach under control. Min gets upset by his unreasonable reaction and steps in to tell Rajue to lay off, but then he turns his anger to Min instead. Min, who grew up in tough urban neighborhoods and was a bit hotheaded herself, got in his face, and things start getting physically violent.</p>
        <p id="p-67f7392872dde2c26384fe4f4f46bf1c" level="2">Asoka, a <bold id="bold-61c239ff8c4d7b558f346d429c249a44">GLOBAL MONASTIC CULT </bold>cadet, steps in and tells them both to calm down. Asoka's <bold id="bold-b38ba567d6299b389e7142e0d96ea703">ESYRUP DAEMON</bold> <bold id="bold-27b9878185e926ffade46ff807c28a33">IRI</bold>, who looks like a flamboyant cuttlefish but is about the size of a medium to large dog, cradles the sick Rhee in its arms while Asoka faces Rajue, who decides to escalate and injects himself with <bold id="bold-681a3ab0fc8724f8038796e5330170a0">WHAMO!</bold>, a popular "mood enhancer" made of adrenaline and instant muscle toner. Asoka uses her capoeira skills to easily pin and subdue Rajue. She tells everyone that she, <bold id="bold-7e0d3d63d347bc3a02b3a5927a7991d3">IRI</bold>, and Min were going to leave with Rhee to help her feel better for the rest of the journey, and Rajue was going to stay in the cafe compartment and behave himself. Rajue brushes himself off and huffily disappears into the crowd of cadets. </p>

        <title>Chapter 3</title>
        <p id="heading-fd32f47dabcc67c636e23b2a1c962bee" level="2">Min and Asoka help Rhee back to her compartment, where Rhee digs through her bags for an anti-nausea pill. Rhee insists that she's fine, she just needs some quiet and good grief, what she'd do for some sparkling water. Min reveals that she'd nicked a couple bottles of sparkling water from the cafe. The girls open bottles of fizzy water over toasts to their newly forged friendship. Rhee confesses that she is terrified of space travel and going crazy out in space, but the <bold id="bold-a183ceddd2e0ee2e7852a5ed3e4962a2">SPACE CONSORTIUM</bold>'s scholarship was the only way she could afford to change her career classification - her parents are morticians, and Rhee doesn't want to work on dead bodies ever again. Asoka is from a very different family - her parents are agricultural researchers, and very deeply involved in the <bold id="bold-8b4ed35dcbaacde63a7be2bf03afcaf4">GLOBAL MONASTIC CULT</bold>. Asoka had a very physically demanding upbringing - farming, capoeira with her father João, climbing trees and building treehouses. She has been training to be a kinetic linguist, or one who can communicate using movement and can understand other species' movement languages. Thanks to the intimate connection that Asoka, like any other member of the <bold id="bold-20f6a75996d9513f39a81d26d5b020df">GLOBAL MONASTIC CULT</bold>, shares with <bold id="bold-7b2381349afee99716169e4760b4ed03">IRI</bold> via her body piercings, she and <bold id="bold-1344c1ff8f9415572258974c34f681ad">IRI </bold>can together turn rapidly and fluidly change Asoka's skin color, similar to the natural abilities of cuttlefish. Min shares how all of the women in her family are mathematicians, and how her <bold id="bold-0c826d5a54c2d5803fdc721555fb3b27">FAMILY GANG</bold> relies on mathematical algorithms for their collective living. But Min wants to be free, able to fly from planet to planet without anyone's permission, because she can build her own space ship and she can find a crew to live and work with. So she's going to train for space swimming certification and learn how to build space shuttles. </p>
        <p id="p-5acfb6f214a4d7fee8c067c3f2c5c061" level="2">As they approach the <bold id="bold-2d4d43fee9bacc3e363cc04eaae76539">GEMINI</bold>, all three of them marvel at its design. The final part of the journey takes them on a slow drift over the station as the shuttle matches its velocity with the station. </p>
        <p id="heading-4cb12550b3bd34acb720d10b791263c4" level="2">The shuttle finally docks with <bold id="bold-f1dc52749b342e2eab0c9cb6e4934ba3">GEMINI </bold>station, as the PA system announces that all cadets must check their entry documents for their crew assignments. Asoka is assigned to <bold id="bold-bb8cd6bdc8f3563988d09ed3d796531e">CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE</bold>, Rhee to <bold id="bold-7f4ef5cf0157322e400b88fb59116a80">MENDELEEVERS</bold>. Min looks for her crew but finds "Undecided" on her documents. PA system calls, "If you are an Undecided, please report to Docking Bay Door 0813." Asoka, Rhee, and Min promise to find each other later. They step out into the docking bay to see the whole school lined up, rank and file, ready to greet the newcomers. "Welcome, muskies!" they roar in unison, as they snap into the ISS Corps cadet salute. "Muskies?" "It's because you all smell of Earth still!"</p>
        <p id="p-91520ae5762b019cb83f5ab2030ccc61" level="2">Min reports to Docking Bay Door 0813 and finds a small group of cadets. She is greeted by third-year cadets Zalo, of the <bold id="bold-e9e90e22bea05ae55ecfc46b855fe3bd">INFRADESTRUCTORS </bold>crew, and Jheri, of the <bold id="bold-61401599af12c382522b1c26be300868">CYBERPHILIA </bold>crew. They both volunteered to show around the Undecideds, which places their crews at the front of the line for who gets to host Undecideds first. </p>
        <p id="p-aaa7573d1a0be665452fabe08ced9021" level="2">Zalo and Jheri explain that the <bold id="bold-95672f9a7ee8dac0f0cfe90d7c7be4d0">SCHOOL SORTING ALGORITHM</bold> didn't have enough data on Undecided cadets, which is why they didn't have a crew yet. They would spend the next week getting to know each of the home crews and would need to pick a homecrew by the end of the week. Day 1 would be with <bold id="bold-2407921e0929581cf944d5af3d9e4385">INFRADESTRUCTORS</bold>, Day 2 with <bold id="bold-3b7cff235730d8494af54a6bae00ef6c">CYBERPHILIA</bold>, Day 3 with <bold id="bold-5ce8a18d90b3159787b604b55d3a8292">CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE</bold>, and Day 4 with <bold id="bold-b55a642097c426cf7941afa85fc0e3d5">MENDELEEVERS</bold>. Day 5 and 6 would be with the home crew of their own choosing, and could be different for each day. On Day 7 they would submit a ranked list of all 4 crews, listed from most preferred to least preferred crew. Each home crew also submits a list of all Undecideds, ranked according to how much they would like to have an Undecided join their crew. Reps from each home crew meet with these lists and negotiate, and anyone who doesn't end up on a crew must leave the school. </p>
        <p id="p-4f602d6c92b0cd0cc453db6e1d0da748" level="2">Zalo then shows the Undecideds a day in the life of the <bold id="bold-30ffeca88c90fd6a3446f176f37bf619">INFRADESTRUCTORS </bold>crew. They are taking apart a <bold id="bold-5df771b91a35b0041042c36b6695d8fc">POCKET SCANNER</bold>, a "universal scanning" device that can obtain measurements of the electromagnetic, material, and cellular properties of any creature or object. Min bonds with many here over the democratization of tech and the social implications of the ban against basic research of <bold id="bold-6a18356fbc6ad657d2794ba224af78d7">ESYRUP</bold>, which is so prevalent and used by so many. The recipe was originally made open source by the inventors of <bold id="bold-2af17a1290e3bb049ea5608d7ea533cb">ESYRUP</bold>, but that was before the Water Crisis made everything more desperate, all material resources so much more precious and dear. </p>
        <p id="p-29e98aa8fee690a62bd8c5dd6175cea7" level="2">After a whirlwind first day, Min and the other scholarship students report to the <bold id="bold-a0c9262c067a8e154d49bfdd416c2443">HEAD OF SERVICE CREW</bold>, who turns out to be a <bold id="bold-e9e2c4732a278bc5dc402c51280e11cf">GANGIE</bold> named <bold id="bold-69ca5cd551fe852c87c2c566f08b8695">PQ</bold>.

Min's head tatoo flares up again, and <bold id="bold-9f75f76195a3e51d425cdf8bdd042aaf">PQ </bold>notices. She insists that Min get to bed at once. </p>

Min bonds with many on this crew over a shared love of anime, live improvisational music, and <bold id="bold-1e4fd026e0e2a075c23ef10535a60fcf">ESYRUP DAEMONS</bold>, as many <bold id="bold-2caa2192437b8a54f685149bc6dc4f82">GLOBAL MONASTIC CULT </bold>members tend to end up in this crew. Many muskies with <bold id="bold-c0bc12ccb00010bd6211e78e84252fb1">ESYRUP </bold>tatoos also end up in the <bold id="bold-a2c3fe8070ec1076fc95eec235fc2bdd">CYBERPHILIA </bold>crew, including Rajue. Zalo also spends a good portion of the day with them, and he and Min continue conversing excitedly about conversations from the day before. </p>
        <p id="p-a968d32c1c4dfad13890bb6de536e306" level="2">Jheri teaches the cadets how to use the laser atomic manipulator (LAM), which allows them to perform surgeries so precise that they can cut out a 1cm cubed volume out from deep inside of a living animal without causing bleeding or needing stitches. Jheri is currently considered one of the top cadets at ISS Corps, in large part for her incredible dexterity and precision with the LAM. She has already begun her Journeyhume training with one of the ISS Corps professors, who invented the most recent version of the LAM, which is an order of magnitude cheaper and more portable. </p>
        <p id="p-a34242edb7c6bc645b71041bbdad53d9" level="2">On Day 3 the Undecideds are dropped off at <bold id="bold-3a02605ead845bfb2ddde7284c9f2426">CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE</bold>, where 3rd-year cadet <bold id="bold-8db012260c69273d067c7f30e81b9070">GIARMO </bold>is leading the day's physical training. Min is initially disappointed that Zalo doesn't stay with the Undecideds this time, but she quickly forgets her disappointment when she sees the <bold id="bold-157cb4cc37a016e055059c6fbcede68f">CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE</bold>'s training and performance spaces. After a morning of rigorous drills, they break for water and fruit before they play games on the playgrounds the crew builds for themselves, a combination of capoeira, parkour, and Okinawan Kobudō. By lunch Min is exhausted but exhilerated. She finds Asoka at lunch and they catch up.

        <p id="heading-798f362278487e0e48c05383cae3c9d3" level="2">It's Day 4, and the Undecideds are with the <bold id="bold-d7dc91aa1b9408ffde855ca35e074510">MENDELEEVERS</bold>, where ISS Corps alum Tross is giving a demonstration of space welding tools as fellow MENDELEEVERS 2nd- and 3rd-year cadets play rapid fire rounds of "What if...in space?!", in which a situation is invented in which something breaks out in space, and no internet is available, and very few technologically optimized tools are available, and thus one must macgyver a solution using un-networked tools. Tross's <bold id="bold-6484e09618e6d9db0acecedf4140c72f">ESYRUP DAEMON</bold>, a midnight black, silky and sinewy cat named <bold id="bold-e83ee50a2af14d1be76e6890ed9e37c3">INQBI</bold>, who could alternate between curling around Tross's shoulders like an adorable, purring scarf, to gliding through night and shadows like a silent, hazel-eyed wave of death and destruction. Min finds Tross's teaching style incredibly exciting and asks such eager questions that Tross and Min continue chatting over lunch, where Min also finds Rhee. Min and Rhee become fast friends with <bold id="bold-c95e7b1177c22260efc078f07110be38">INQBI</bold>, who shares their fondness for fried cheese. Min's head tatoo flares up again, and Tross asks Min if she's alright. She explains that she might have some mild <bold id="bold-258f189b8d1596a97f4527f47bc6396e">ESYRUP </bold>contamination, but she's gotten some pills to help with it. Tross abruptly leaves. </p>
        <p id="p-6140bfbc8f5d0cd6f5b3261c330ecfed" level="2">After lunch, Rhee introduces Min to Oana, another <bold id="bold-128ab2d6d4e1c43783979b5a7b0f8d07">NORMIE </bold>who has become an expert at blowing microscopic bio-compatible <bold id="bold-0d6e4182deef045c3d47188a349916c3">ESYRUP</bold>-infused glass filaments, which can be gently embedded subdermally to create programmable, interactive "mod-makeup". Oana shows them how to verify each piece to certify it safe for subdermal injection. While they work, Rhee teases Min for her fascination with Tross. Oana reveals that Tross was a muskie during the same year as she and Zalo and Jheri, but he is the first and only cadet to graduate in one year - most students take the full 3, and occassionally someone graduates in 2 years. Tross is now a 2nd-year journeyhume at Space University as an independent space welder, but he returns to the ISS Corps for the first week of the year, to be part of the initiation week and hold workshops and demonstrations for the <bold id="bold-2dce4281f5a37f55983fcd360b7b2301">MENDELEEVERS</bold>.  </p>
        <p id="p-5025dde691ba11532a6a7cc236e25ded" level="2">On Day 5, Min decides to go back to the <bold id="bold-50789e7bed06ea74ead13f6e2e031e84">MENDELEEVERS</bold>. She spends the morning unsuccessfully searching for Tross while learning how to bake sourdough bread in space. After lunch, she joins Rhee for a workshop on "Common chemicals on space vessels with surprising properties", where Rhee proves to be a natural at chemical alchemy. After the workshop, Min wanders around the <bold id="bold-eba50827bf50b93fa9ad48df914fc503">MENDELEEVERS</bold>' area until she spies <bold id="bold-2cf776dbfbbebc62007a143a6eb619a4">INQBI </bold>disappearing around a corner. She steps into a workroom where she runs into Tross, who grabs her by the shoulders and makes her look at him and not the workroom behind him. He tries to encourage her to leave, but Min thinks it's a joke and tries to playfully fight her way past him. He doesn't let her go though, and their grappling becomes more earnest. Tross grips Min, too hard, she cries out in pain, and Tross says, deadly serious, "Min, if you value your life, turn around and walk out of the room right now." Utterly shaken, Min flees. </p>

        <title>Chapter 6</title>
        <p id="p-dd9f188bd43df6fa8b2920d25cdc19a5" level="2">Min spends Day 6 with Asoka and the <bold id="bold-a476adbd494034e032f92404f3bf2905">CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE</bold> crew. She had slept in Asoka's sleeping structure the night before, she was so confused and frightened by Tross's behaviour. She and Asoka had discussed it until late into the night, and now, the next day, she just wants to shut up the questions in her head with blindingly difficult physical challenges, so she and Asoka work on space swimming drills until they reach lunch time, exhausted. Everyone is super excited by how quickly Min's space swimming is improving, especially Asoka, who has been training space swimming since childhood and has been looking for another skilled swimmer to help with her experiments in multi-partner synchronized space swimming, which could be a new way to accomplish certain build and maintenance tasks for space vessels. Min spends a wonderful lunch with Asoka, <bold id="bold-d3b14280564101efd67e9e4073e1d820">GIARMO</bold>, and numerous other admiring cadets, many of whom ask Min if she would consider joining the <bold id="bold-53c41c9505f2d07a17ab6068d5cb1429">CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE</bold> crew. </p>
        <p id="p-458e343014699671ac07ab3f5addfc82" level="2">In the afternoon, while studying an old philosophical play about Rosalind Franklin, Zalo and Jheri come to find Min. He asks her if she feels able to make a ranked list of home crews, and which crew she feels the most connection with. Min is horribly torn, she loves every crew for different reasons! She goes on to Zalo about the things she loves about each crew and what she feels she could learn from all of them. Zalo and Jheri exchange a look. They sternly tell her to study her feelings more closely and come to a decision, as she will not be allowed to learn craft/trade secrets outside her home crew's career class qualifications. And if she cannot find a home crew to join, she will have to leave the school. Zalo, oddly formal, shakes her hand as he and Jheri leave to find the next Undecided. Min realises he is slipping her a note, as he says, darkly suggestive, "If you're still torn by midnight tonight...they might be able to help." </p>
        <p id="p-40868d3e54942438aeb086d83387d45f" level="2">Min waits to go to the toilet before looking at the note, which contains a cryptic message. Min spends the rest of the day decoding it, in the end recruiting Asoka and Rhee to help her. It's a location, and a passcode. Rhee thinks it's a bad idea, maybe a nasty prank, and doesn't want Min to go alone. Asoka is terribly curious, and wants to go with Min to see what this is all about. Min decides she wants to at least know what sort of help is being offered, and decides to go. Rhee and Asoka insist on joining her, using <bold id="bold-788fd3f99cd858cc3af57e1257b8379b">IRI </bold>to camouflage their presence. Rhee also insists on assembling a makeshift chemical weapon, just in case. </p>
        <p id="p-296287830b62ab0a67cba818748f2387" level="2">When Min arrives at the secret location, she is greeted by two masked cadets, who coldly ask if she came alone. Min says yes, praying that they cannot detect Rhee and Asoka and <bold id="bold-dfef3daa1291328bdc4fbda450a7aa8f">IRI</bold>. The 2 masked cadets then scan her with <bold id="bold-b998109ba17465d7899599224c8d40bc">POCKET SCANNERS</bold> and find Rhee, Asoka, and <bold id="bold-14bf57989511109dcdec6ffeca519c40">IRI</bold>. There is some confusion over the unexpected turn of events, as the situation turns into a standoff. Rhee uses her makeshift chem weapon, which reveals the masked cadets to be wearing some kind of personal protective force field. Asoka tries hand to hand combat but one of the masked cadets is able to subdue her with a sheathed sword. A mysterious <bold id="bold-cd21a34971eff30dc7c4198d76b13d55">ESYRUP DAEMON</bold> pools into existence out of the shadows to subdue <bold id="bold-507bffdb4b496b66a84509e71bef227b">IRI</bold>. The two masked cadets then turn on a <bold id="bold-f4dfb2074954e7aac720cacb323b1270">SIGNAL SCRAMBLER BUBBLE</bold> and show Min the results of their <bold id="bold-8aa2bd64155050b203f68ab552db84c3">POCKET SCANNERS</bold>: Min has a government tracer in her nervous system, one that harvests biomarker data from her and sends it to an untraceable location. Rhee, whose parents developed the first commercial <bold id="bold-c9f0a58a429e0ae18997095be16ba6ac">POCKET SCANNERS</bold>, confirms their diagnosis. The masked cadets tell Min that if she wants to stay at the ISS Corps, she needs to get the tracer removed. Min is appalled that her bio-data has been harvested for the last week without her permission, but she's scared - won't whoever put this in her come after her if they see that the tracer isn't sending sensible data anymore? Also, how could she trust masked strangers to perform this surgery on her? "Please," says one of the masked cadets, "trust us, you need to remove this tracer. It can collect stressful or suggestive mind states, save the parameters, and artificially re-trigger that mindset in you, even remotely." </p>
        <p id="p-2b25838de93aeeca120eacf8d72cafca" level="2">Min is growing increasingly frightened, and the masked cadets increasingly frustrated. Finally, they come to a decision, and take off their masks - it's Jheri and Zalo. Jheri says, "Look, I'm the best at this kind of surgery, even if I'm still not even a Journeyhume. Please let me take this tracer out of you." Min agrees, realising that she trusts these two deeply. </p>

        <p id="p-1057f9c0e745002aa16470646ae8185f">Jheri carefully and painstakingly removes the tracer from Min. After the surgery, Rhee and Asoka and Min demand answers from Jheri and Zalo. They decide to take down the <bold id="bold-2da2d1c72649017635c5851545d7ca02">SIGNAL SCRAMBLER BUBBLE</bold> and go for a walk.</p>
        <p id="p-d702cf2bd50c6b394f3e10770f2f1e10">Jheri and Zalo walk Min through a maze of interstitial spaces on <bold id="bold-69ae10f1baab62aaea5ae6afeea51366">GEMINI</bold> to get to another secret room, where <bold id="bold-73140fd88898d90888be3108858ef647">ADI</bold>, Tross, Oana, <bold id="bold-cfbe87d805c80432551dd8f423d40b34">GIARMO</bold>, and a few others are gathered. Zalo reveals that these are members of a secret society here at the ISS Corps, who are trying to reverse engineer the formula for making living, self-replicating and evolving <bold id="bold-11e530e23d7605acbd3eb1979c93c70b">ESYRUP</bold>, and who have realised that they need skills and expertise from across the different home crews. They call themselves Vigilante Intergalactic Roustabout Scholars (VIRS). </p>
        <p id="p-2fd21a91fba2565f09e922acf17b0c9f">The VIRS show Min, Rhee, and Asoka their results so far. Tross, Jheri, and Zalo have figured out how to enable <bold id="bold-c961323e98a96cafda93bfac5358581d">INQBI </bold>to completely change shape and size, turning into an amorphous shadowy blob then reforming. Oana and <bold id="bold-af5aa643756c67965ec1b355173dbb31">GIARMO</bold> have started to grow plants that are spliced with <bold id="bold-f3541647f5ce06c98b8ebf1f4c4e560e">ESYRUP</bold>.</p>
