## Chapter 1

*The great Colorado River is now but a forgotten memory. The lucrative farms in northern California, bread basket of West America, sucked it dry in 2092, ruining that year's crops and sparking riots.*

*The lack of sufficient alternatives has plunged the nation into a seemingly endless drought, and the anger, some righteous, has all turned into fear. The horrors of the GREAT NORTH AMERICAN WAR OF 2047 that birthed West America are still fresh in the minds of grandparents, but that doesn't stop the country from imploding into chaos and violence.*

*The **SPACE CONSORTIUM** ran the numbers and found that a civil war affecting one of their legacy technological strongholds, Silicon Valley, would be massively unprofitable.*

Corporate shill: *"We cannot allow the unrest in West America to disrupt the construction of the new shuttle launch pad in Old North Carolina. It's only been 10 years since we regained some semblence of economic stability in North America, and we must not lose the precious ground we gained."*

*They decided to offer asylum to the families of any young West American refugees willing to become a "scholarship student" at the ISS Corps -- their flagship educational project for teenagers, an international training program for youth interested in career class "Interplanetary Travel and Communications".*

*The scholarship meant that these students could attend the ISS Corps for free, and receive financial support for their university-level training of choice.*

*It also meant that they committed 5 years of their wage-earning years to the **SPACE CONSORTIUM**.*

*Soon enough, applications from young refugees began pouring into the ISS Corps. The **SPACE CONSORTIUM** was applauded for their great humanitarian effort and dedication to diversity.* 

**A gradiose SPACE CONSORTIUM logo becomes a watermark on a publicity brochure being read by Min's mother as she recovers in a hospital bed.**

Min's mother: *"...In addition to conducting collaborative scientific research in crews advised by a world-class teaching staff, youth cadets will learn about the day-to-day operations at a shuttle launch and repair station by participating in station staff work crews."*

**Min's mother looks up from the brochure at Min.**

Min's mother: *"Really, this sounds perfect for you!"*

**Min is with her family in a hospital room where her mother is being treated for injuries sustained while escaping the riots in their hometown of Berkeley, West America. They are now in Vancouver, Canada, because the hospitals in West America won't even let you through the front door without an insurance card. Min's family was part of the well-educated elite of Silicon Valley, which is now been destroyed by the riots in West America sparked by a massive food shortage after a brutal drought killed over 80% of the nation's farms.** 

**While Min's mother is recovering in the hospital, she finds an advert about the ISS Corps. She urges Min to apply, who has been obsessed with space travel ever since she took a ride in a space shuttle as a small child. Min is initially excited to hear about the SPACE CONSORTIUM'S offer to waive tuition to the ISS Corps, but she is reluctant to leave her family after the trauma of being driven out of their home. To make her feel even worse, her parents are activists who protest the use of the ansible for secret government surveillance and military oppression, and while the SPACE CONSORTIUM hasn't done anything like that directly themselves, their members include several economically affluent and morally questionable organizations, so they are criticised for nurturing an environment which condones surveillance and oppression. Min's parents also don't like the conditions of the scholarship, but they also see very few other options for getting Min the certifications she needs in order to work in space travel. Her parents are also in a position with little options, as they lost everything when they fled West America. The whole family has been relying completely on the generosity of Vancouver General Hospital for nearly a year, and they all agree that with this scholarship, they have a chance to regain their dignity and independence.**

## Chapter 2

**The Climate Change Reality Project has now trained so many people in the world that all kinds of grassroots environmental organizations have started to incubate quite naturally, as more and more people develop sustainable daily habits and sensibilities. Unfortunately they are still massively outnumbered by those still tied to life in the huge urban centers, where every amenity could be delivered, straight to your bed in some cases, for an easy, "convenient" price. The fake news crisis revealed just how truly incapable humans had become at building trust, and the distrustful masses now lean heavily on brand names to flag trustworthy sources of information and moral judgement.**

**A new generation of urban farmers, PROTO-VIRS, living at the fringes of these urban tumours have been taking over abandoned million-dollar apartments (another "convenient" price, just half the price of last year's Volkwagon e-Mini, perfect for your government mandated 2-children limited family! *plastic smile*) and turning them into farming schools. After a decade of bliss, the SPACE CONSORTIUM found the PROTO-VIRS graduates so competent and their farming so successful that they gave the PROTO-VIRS an offer they couldn't refuse -- give SPACE CONSORTIUM their research, and SPACE CONSORTIUM will guarantee the PROTO-VIRS "green havens", places protected from the onslaught of urban development. In short, the PROTO-VIRS agreed to keep pockets of the planet natural in order to conduct agricultural research for the benefit of a space exploration corporation.**

notes on the above: make this a story told by one character to another. maybe Min to Asoca? Or maybe a teacher?

**The PROTO-VIRS and the SPACE CONSORTIUM have a mutually respectful but skeptical attitude towards each other. The PROTO-VIRS realize that they need to preserve a secret set of knowledge and traditions, teaching their students how to guard against the mild-mannered and accommodating facade of the SPACE CONSORTIUM. Asoca's mother is a student of the PROTO-VIRS, trained in GREEN HAVEN DEVON and stationed at GREEN HAVEN SHETLAND with her husband, a permaculture farmer from Devon. They raise Asoca on an agricultural research station as loyal scientists of the SPACE CONSORTIUM, but that is a facade that hides their knowledge and practice of the history and traditions of the PROTO-VIRS, and their hope for a humanity mature enough to live in true freedom, without slavery of any kind. The PROTO-VIRS have realised the lesson of their own, voluntary slavery: in the face of brutally aggressive urbanization, fueled by coldly logical capitalism, natural spaces and biological diversity on this planet will always be in danger. Now the PROTO-VIRS search for ways to preserve the biological heritage of the Earth.**

note: maybe this whole thing is a story told by a VIRS, several generations later?

**Asoca has dreamed of joining the ISS Corps and studying at Space University, just like her mother, ever since she could remember. She is going through her offer letter to join the ISS Corps while cuddled up with her mother on a bench swing in a beautiful garden. Asoca is nervous about leaving GREEN HAVEN SHETLAND and going to APPALACHIA, her first trip across an ocean. She will be very far from the familiar faces, sights, smells, and sounds of her home, where she's lived since she was born at the local hospital 16 years ago. But she's also excited -- in the last year, she's been helping her mother research plants useful for space travel, and she has many ideas about how to build better space architecture to facilitate keeping plants alive in space. She's also excited by the possibility of meeting other children raised by PROTO-VIRS, which her mother assures her is highly likely in the ISS Corps.**

## Chapter 3

**During Asoca's induction week at the Kennedy Memorial Shuttle Launch and Maintenance Station ("the Kennedy Station"), built just south of the old ruins of the historic Kennedy Space Center, she completely resonates with the CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE's ethos and home structures. Her cheery attitude is endearing to most but annoying to some, especially Min, who is now a 2nd-year cadet on the CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE home crew. Min is now readily acknowledged as the best space swimmer currently studying at the ISS Corps, and she's beaten nearly every space swimming record the school holds. But in the last year, Min has realised the truth of the SPACE CONSORTIUM's "scholarship" -- she is expected to work part-time on the ISS Corps' service crews (janitorial, cafeteria, grounds keeping, waste & recycling, stores & mail) for every year of her apprenticeship. This only strengthens Min's resolve to be amongst the top 10 students in her graduating cohort (the top 10 receive fully paid fellowships for their university level training), so she studies and trains her space swimming skills with furious discipline. She is, by her own admission, "picky" about her collaborators, and not very extroverted; she prefers to watch the first-years from afar, and shows friendliness only in quieter moments. Min judges Asoca to be naive and privileged, unaware of life outside her own tiny bubble, until the home crew has a training session, and Min sees Asoca's more disciplined, martial side when Asoca plays capoeira. Min finds herself unable to stop watching Asoca, and is drawn to get to know her.**

## Chapter 4

**Min is one of many of cadets who share an appreciation (some might say obsession) with cephalopods. Last year the OCEAN SCIENCE CREW did an intensive observation study of freely-swimming cuttlefish in an environment where they can hunt "robotic prey" (Cuttle Shuttle), and they now want to analyze the video and figure out how to apply the movement stabilization that cuttlefish achieve during tentacle shots to human space swimming techniques and space module connection protocols. The first challenge that must be solved is to define the tentacle shot pattern in a way that a computer can understand. The next challenge is to teach a computer to reliably track an animal that is evolved to actively camouflage against predators that rely on visual tracking. Once the automated tracking allows the crew to have standardized video clips of every tentacle shot recorded in the video dataset, the next challenge is to decide how to visualize, find, and interpret patterns found within these video clips. The final challenge would be to then translate the movement patterns from cuttlefish in water to human or mechanical bodies in outer space. These will be the goals of OCEAN SCIENCE CREW this year.** 

**The OCEAN SCIENCE CREW consists of Min; her crew co-captain Zalo, from the INFRADESTRUCTORS crew, who helped build the environment and observation rig, in addition to helping program the robotic prey used to entice the cuttlefish into behaving; Joerry, also of CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE, who knows how to raise cuttlefish in capitivity and is considered the local animal husbandry expert; Atehban, from the CYBERPHILIA crew, to do the automated tracking and video dataset digestion; Ceddit, also from the INFRADESTRUCTORS crew, to translate the cuttlefish movements to the human body in order to present a report on the cuttlefish research's applicability to improving space swimming techniques (HIVE TRACKER). Rhee of the MENDELEEVERS, another first-year cadet, also joins the OCEAN SCIENCE CREW. Adi, an ISS Corps professor on the teaching staff for "Health and Well-Being in Space", is their faculty mentor.**

**Asoca becomes interested in the Cuttle Shuttle project for its applications to space modules and space architecture, and joins the OCEAN SCIENCE CREW. As Asoca and Min work together, they have many conversations expressing their philosophies about teaching and society, and realise that they share some fundamental values, even though they have different plans of action deriving from those values. They realise that they both believe in the power of education and the necessity of subversion and critical thought in a society, but Asoca believes that a wise leader can best nurture these two cultural tools, and Min believes that individuals must maintain constant vigilance against leaders using these two cultural tools.**

## Chapter 5

**As Asoca spends more time with Min, Asoca realises that Min works part-time on the service crews, in addition to everything else she does in order to be a top 10 student. She finds it unfair that Min is judged according to the same criteria as those students who are not required to dedicate half of their time to service crew duties. Asoca tries to convince Min and the other scholarship students to boycott their service crew duties, and the scholarship students reveal that the money they earn during their part-time work directly impacts the amount of financial aid given to their families. Asoca finds this exploitative, and tries to rally the other students to show solidarity with the scholarship students and demand better conditions for their scholarship. But most of the other students do not find the conditions of the scholarship so offensive, or they are unwilling to spend time on this instead of on their coursework and training, or they are so cynical that they don't think any good will come of speaking up about the terms of the scholarships. Even Min would rather "play the game well". Asoca also realises that there are no children of PROTO-VIRS amongst the scholarship students, even though some of the PROTO-VIRS children come from the same areas as some scholarship students.**

**Asoca also makes a strong connection with Petros, a third-year journeyman at Space University who visits the Kennedy Station often to see his nephew Clavel, one of the MENDELEEVERS. Petros is one of the engineers coordinating the most recent batch of renovations for the Kennedy Station and a teaching assistant at Space University who specialises in space welding. Petros was a MENDELEEVER at ISS Corps and was primarily responsible for adding a forge to the MENDELEEVER workspaces. Petros and Asoca bond over a shared passion for the inherent good of space exploration, even while being challenged by each other's methods of going about it: Petros believes in prioritizing the strength and longevity of space structures through a reliance on technologically enhanced inorganic materials, while Asoca believes in prioritizing the strength and longevity of the space-faring people through a reliance on sustainable life cycles for material and psychological resources.**

## Chapter 6

**A year has passed, and it is Min's final year with the ISS Corps. In order to complete their certification, youth cadets must spend at least one year conducting scientific research and at least one year building educational exhibits showcasing this research in the context of one of their required topics for apprenticeship certification. Asoca and Min now share a joint sleeping structure, and they have formed the INTERACTIVE EXHIBITS crew, with plans to use outdated and/or recycled space shuttle/station cameras and monitors, which are deployed by advertising companies to track the visual gaze of passers-by, to build educational exhibits teaching the general public about how our brains build, adjust, break, and re-build our "internal model of the world", a topic from one of their required courses, "Health and Well-being in Space" (SURPRISING MINDS). Others on the INTERACTIVE EXHIBITS are Daru, of the CYBERPHILIA crew; and Clavel, of the MENDELEEVERS. Zalo, who graduated in the top 10 last year and chose to stay with the ISS Corps for his university certification, is now a journeyman systems engineer and gets the INTERACTIVE EXHIBITS crew access to the outdated and recycled hardware that they need.**

## Chapter 7

**Asoca hasn't told anyone besides Min yet, but she also plans to graduate this year. She's impatient to complete her training and really start having an impact. Asoca has realised that the "human brain == computer" analogy destoys our ability to build trust, in each other and in our own selves, because we become conditioned to believe that learning to how to trust can be reduced to a quantifiable optimization function. Together, Asoca and Min are realising that humans cannot advance as a super-organism until we re-learn how to build trust, and we regain our evolutionary ability to spread out to where there is room and resources for us instead of being stuck in increasingly over-crowded locations because we've forgotten how to survive without our infrastructures of convenience. During this final year, they share their dreams with each other. Asoca wants to liberate the PROTO-VIRS by building space farms, and creating green spaces for growing food and natural life cycles that are out of the reach of the SPACE CONSORTIUM and any haphazard overflow of the aggressive urbanization still ravaging the Earth. Min wants to make space travel accessible to anyone but especially the now impoverished and homeless refugees from West America. She feels that refugees can have a second chance by becoming space nomads, and building homes for themselves that are safe from climate change and ignorant politicians trying to standardize procedures for populations too large and diverse to be standardized. They promise to be strong in their goals, even though they must part ways: Asoca will go to Space University, while Min has chosen to stay with the ISS Corps.**
