## Asoca
Most people call Asoca as "Soca". Grew up in a small rural community in northern Europe, idyllic and affluent -- it is one of the few natural spaces left on planet Earth. Her mother is an herbalist who studies plants useful for space travel (exo-hydroponics). Her father is a farmer specializing in permaculture. Both are agricultural engineers doing government funded research for the military. Soca dreams of becoming an architect who specialises in "living structures", where human-friendly spaces, with all of the modern amenities, are integrated into and nurture living trees. 

Soca is very happy and energetic, kind to a fault, and well-meaning but naive. She loves raising, observing, studying, and caring for the many animals that live around her home. She is good with grand ideas and inspiring large groups of people, though very self-deprecating and more introverted than she presents. Very generous with friends and colleagues and often cheerful, but goes through bouts of cynicism when too many take advantage of her generosity and good nature. Enjoys the quiet and wild beauty of rural living but is drawn to cities and the sensation of being part of a super-organism.

#### family life
Soca's mother is a government funded agricultural researcher. She's a badass and potentially involved in some illuminati shit. She carefully and meticulously teaches Soca as much as she can about the "real world", but has to be careful not to overwhelm Soca and not endanger her either, too much knowledge being dangerous in these times. 

Soca had a very classical education - think European elite. 

## Min
Grew up in the affluent part of a large urban area, which has now been destroyed by civil war when drought killed over 80% of the farms supplying the city (some kind of future Aleppo -- maybe Silicon Valley? California could be having earthquakes, forest fires, drought, WWIII with Russia...). Her mother is a mathematician who worked on the ansible but retired to teach high school. Her father is an artist activist/hacker who has been protesting the application of the ansible for secret government surveillance and military oppression. When they became refugees, Min decided to leave her family in order to join the ISS Corps. 

Min is a meticulous worker who prefers working alone because not enough people meet her standards for competence, but she loves to coordinate ambitious projects with a small group of trusted collaborators. She's picky about everything: her food, her friends, and how she spends her time. Small but swift, and sharp as a tack, Min is very resourceful and always tinkering. She's not anti-social, but she's picky and honest, and has found that not everyone appreciates that kind of glaring perspective, so she's a bit shy. She always has something in her hands to play with and calm her nervous energy in social situations. Though pessimistic about human systems, she's convinced that the destructive tendencies in human nature are the result of generations of indoctrination by a corporate oligarchy. Believes in the ideal role of education to free humans from oppressive systems and to empower humans to live in a society of true equals.
