## Asoca
Most people call Asoca as "Soca". Grew up in a small agricultural research village on the Orkney Islands, affluent for its ties to military research on space farming and one of the few natural spaces left on planet Earth. Her mother is an herbalist who studies plants useful for space travel (exo-hydroponics). Her father is a farmer specializing in permaculture, whose parents left their animal sanctuary in the Amazon River Basin when it was destroyed in a forest fire. They came to Devon a few years before Asoca's father was born, and raised him as a farmer. Both of Soca's parents are agricultural engineers doing government funded research for the military. Soca dreams of becoming an architect who specialises in "living structures", where human-friendly spaces, with all of the modern amenities, are integrated into and nurture living trees. 

Soca is very happy and energetic, kind to a fault, and well-meaning but naive. She loves raising, observing, studying, and caring for the many animals that live around her home. She is good with grand ideas and inspiring large groups of people, though very self-deprecating and more introverted than she presents. Very generous with friends and colleagues and often cheerful, but goes through bouts of cynicism when too many take advantage of her generosity and good nature. Enjoys the quiet and wild beauty of rural living but is drawn to cities and the sensation of being part of a super-organism.

Soca's childhood education was a mix of European elite (classical piano, figure drawing, tea) and Brazilian street (forro, capoeira, pao de queijo). 

### Parents

Soca's mother is a government funded agricultural researcher and a member of the **PROTO-VIRS**, which was started by urban farmers who turned abandoned million-dollar apartments into urban farming schools. Soca's mother is an alum of both the ISS Corps and Space University -- she graduated with specializations in exo-hydroponics and exo-biology. Soca's mother came from an old noble family, very proud, but was a bit of a wild child and always quite headstrong. She met Soca's father, a permaculture farmer born of immigrant parents, while doing post-graduate agricultural research at **GREEN HAVEN DEVON** in Southwest England. She demanded that her family accept their marriage, which they did with resignation borne of long experience with her iron will. Afterwards, Soca's mother and father accepted positions at **GREEN HAVEN SHETLAND** as agricultural researchers for the **SPACE CONSORTIUM**. They raise Asoca with the modern education and opportunities available to those privileged enough to be employed by the **SPACE CONSORTIUM**, while also teaching Soca the history and traditions of the **PROTO-VIRS**, the wary sensibilities of one who can find a principled path even while greeting one's oppressors with open arms and a smile in the name of survival, and the hope for a humanity mature enough to live in true freedom, without slavery of any kind. 

## Min
Min's family was part of the well-educated elite of Silicon Valley, which is now been destroyed by the riots in West America sparked by a massive food shortage after a brutal drought killed over 80% of the nation's farms. The night they were driven out of their home, Min's mother was wounded by a rioting crowd. Min and her father carried Min's mother north into Canada in search of a hospital that would treat Min's mother without an insurance registration. While Min's mother is recovering in the hospital, she finds an advert about the ISS Corps. She urges Min to apply, who is reluctant to leave her family after the trauma of being driven out of their home. But it's been nearly a year, and Min's father promises to bring her home immediately if her mother's condition worsens.

When Min was 6 years old, she traveled with her parents to a Space Shuttle maintenance and launch station in Japan, where her father was part of an art show celebrating the history of space travel and the unifying effect of space travel on humanity. They took a short sub-orbital flight, just enough to feel zero-gravity and see the curvature of the planet. Ever since then, Min has been obsessed with space travel. She craves to feel zero-gravity again, and to travel far out into space enough so that she can see the whole planet like a blue marble. 

Min is a meticulous worker who prefers working alone because not enough people meet her standards for competence, but she loves to coordinate ambitious projects with a small group of trusted collaborators. She's picky about everything: her food, her friends, and how she spends her time. Small but swift, and sharp as a tack, Min is very resourceful and always tinkering. She's not anti-social, but she's picky and honest, and has found that not everyone appreciates that kind of glaring perspective, so she's a bit shy. She always has something in her hands to play with and calm her nervous energy in social situations. Though pessimistic about human systems, she's convinced that the destructive tendencies in human nature are the result of generations of indoctrination by a corporate oligarchy. Believes in the ideal role of education to free humans from oppressive systems and to empower humans to live in a society of true equals.

Though Min finds satisfaction and comfort in the predictable logic of mathematics, her father kept music a prominent part of her upbringing, and taught her to sing and play violin, guitar, and bass. Because of the demands made on high school teachers, Min was raised more by her father, who made up little impromptu songs for every day tasks like brushing one's teeth, cooking food, or putting on clothes. 

### Parents

Min's mother is a Korean mathematician born in Seoul, who worked on the **SPACE CONSORTIUM ANSIBLE PROJECT** as a young math prodigy until she found out that the satellite she was building would be used to censor space communications and monitor academics suspected of harboring critical views towards the **SPACE CONSORTIUM**. She and a group of colleagues tried to blow the whistle on the **SPACE CONSORTIUM**, but the **SPACE CONSORTIUM** was able to cover everything up. In the aftermath, Min's mother left her position at the **SPACE CONSORTIUM ANSIBLE PROJECT** and became a maths professor at SungKyungKwan University (SKKU). While working a side hustle as a music reviewer for a local newspaper, she attended an **ARTIVISTS INTERNATIONAL** concert where she met Min's father. Min's father is a musician activist/hacker from Berkeley, California in West America, who is amongst the many that believe that the **SPACE CONSORTIUM** instigated the **GREAT NORTH AMERICAN WAR OF 2047**, which divided the old United States of America into 4 new nations: West America, New Texas, Appalachia, and New England. Min's father is one of many musicians touring with **ARTIVISTS INTERNATIONAL**, whose concerts use music and art to protest, among other things, the application of the ansible for secret government surveillance and military oppression. Min's mother and father stayed in touch even after **ARTIVISTS INTERNATIONAL** left Korea to continue with their world tour. Two years later, Min's mother came to University of California, Berkeley for a sabbatical, and ended up marrying Min's father and staying in West America. She leaves academia to teach high school maths, and she and her husband raise Min to be an outspoken, pro-active citizen who demands transparency and checks on the powers of politicians.   

# Other ISS Corps youth cadets

## CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE
They are generally preoccupied with circus and theatrical storytelling, bodily morphologies/anatomies/physiologies, and how thought and movement are connected. They like to build aquariums, terrariums, and playgrounds for humans of all sizes. Their home structures are kinetic and encourage daily training. They maintain a space swimming practice facility and a "normal gravity" dance studio/training space.

### Joerry
Raised by PROTO-VIRS veterinarians, she knows how to care for many different animal species and has a knack for animal husbandry. Loves to learn languages (other human languages, different animal languages, fantasy/alien languages) and extremely kind-hearted. 

### Giam
Another scholarship student, he is a bit stand-off-ish and not super talkative, but very reliable and loyal once he's decided that he likes you. Wants to join the Security division of the **SPACE CONSORTIUM** and so is very focused and serious about his martial arts training, but loves beer and becomes very relaxed when drinking. 

## CYBERPHILIA
Generally preoccupied with technologically-mediated communication, control, and governance. They love to tinker with robotics, AI, automated processes, and electronics. They also build wired and wireless networks, create digital art, love anime and other digital storytelling media, and play lots of video games (historical console/PC games, VR/AR games, simulator room games). They maintain the digital tools database, a film and music recording studio, and a radio station.

### Atehban
Another scholarship student, he had almost completed building a robot to help his elderly grandmother around the house when riots hit his town. He's now brought the robot with him and works on it constantly, as his way of dealing with the death of his grandmother, who raised him.  

### Daru
Grew up near a Formula 1 racing track and befriended the race car crews as a child. Has an incredible intuition for electronically-controlled mechanical systems. Loves ice-cream and eats it at least once a day. 

## MENDELEEVERS 
generally preoccupied with the manipulation of materials, using both cutting-edge tech and simple old-fashioned methods. They combine techniques from chemistry, physics, and traditional hand crafts to build both beautiful and practical art and devices. They like to play "what if...in space?", in which a situation is invented in which something breaks out in space, and no internet is available, and very few technologically optimized tools are available, and thus one must macgyver a solution using un-networked tools. They maintain the machine shop, fabrication labs, and workspaces for traditional hand crafts.

### Marq
A scholarship student full of mischevious energy and unstoppable cheerfulness. Loves to find ways of subverting the no smoking rules and runs homebrew experiments in his sleeping structure.

### Rhee
A surgeon's daughter, she is extremely meticulous and hygienic, both physically and emotionally. She also has a very macabre sense of humour and is fascinated by the mental disorders that can afflict those who spend long periods of time in space without going planetside. 

### Oana
Party girl from a small beach town who creates her own light- and sound-interactive costumes and outfits using homegrown bio-compatible silicon circuits. Child of PROTO-VIRS. 

### Clavel
Loves carpentry and woodwork. Always carries small knives for whittling. The knives are handmade gifts from his uncle Petros, who is a space welder at Space University. Petros visits Clavel often at the ISS Corps. 

## INFRADESTRUCTORS
Preoccupied with understanding the basic facilities, services, and installations needed for the healthy functioning of a society or organization, and with "un-black-boxing" these facilities, services, and installations (meaning that they want to know how things like plumbing, electricity, sewage systems, etc work, and then they want to modify these systems and document these systems well enough that other people can play/hack with them). They liase with the station management team and maintain the utilities shared by the home crews.

### Zalo
Obsessed with video games, reactive computing systems, and food. A workaholic, he's always experimenting with the latest "instant nutrition" food products to find the perfect balance of delicious taste and super-fast, convenient prep. 

### Ceddit
Raised by radical PROTO-VIRS in the suburbs of Paris, is cheerfully extremely distrustful of all authority and was raised without any pharmaceutical mood stabilizers, which is now considered very rare and potentially dangerous. His father was a space shuttle pilot who died when his shuttle collided with some space debris, which raised public awareness of space debris and convinced the **SPACE CONSORTIUM** to create a sector in charge of monitoring, moving, and destroying space debris.
