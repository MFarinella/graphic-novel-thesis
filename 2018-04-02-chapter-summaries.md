Chapters will be organized thus: 

## How to fit my research projects into the plot
During the summer youth program, all "youth cadets" conduct a science exploration. Minka and Asoca choose to study cuttlefish hunting behaviour ([**Cuttle Shuttle**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/cuttlefish-hunting-behavior/)) in order to develop new space swimming techniques based on flexible scaling of the timing of movements ([**Movement control**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/movement-control-across-timescales/)), especially for rapid stabilization in zero-G environments. 

Youth cadets that excel during the summer program are invited to spend a 1-year apprenticeship with the ISS corps, during which they learn how to maintain the shuttles and present a project exploring the life cycle of resources used to build and maintain space shuttles. Minka and Asoca become apprentices and use outdated or recycled space shuttle cameras and monitors to build interactive exhibits that teach the public about the ISS corps mission and day-to-day activities ([**Surprising Minds**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/surprising-minds-brighton/)). 

During that year, Asoca meets Urban Planner and by the end of Asoca's apprenticeship they co-write a short manifesto on the "Social Responsibilities of the Intellectually Privileged, with an especial focus on those who build infrastructure" ([**Philosophy and Ethics**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/scientific-philosophy-ethics/)). Also during that year, Minka meets Lead Engineer and they both get very bad first impressions of each other. During the second half of the apprenticeship, all apprentices wishing to stay with the ISS corps instead of going to a university for baccalaureate certification are required to take courses on the ISS corps's Theories of Science and Engineering ([**Theoretical Puzzle Pieces**](http://www.danbeekim.org/brainplay/2018-02-02-theoretical-puzzle-pieces/)). Minka takes these courses and through the class discussions realizes that Lead Engineer shares some of her most fundamental values.
