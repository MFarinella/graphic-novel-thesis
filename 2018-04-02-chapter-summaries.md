## Chapter 1: The Last Summer Together, Our Last Summer
Minka and Asoca meet at the transport hub nearest to the ISS MAINTENANCE STATION, where they will be spending the summer as part of the ISS Corps Youth Program. They are old friends, having spent the last 6 summers together, though they live very far from each other. Asoca and Minka met each other at a summer camp for creative learning. Asoca had been going to this summer camp since she was 8. Minka didn't start coming to this camp until she was 11, at a time when Asoca was 12. Min and Soca, as they were called, became fast friends during the 4 weeks of their first summer together.

This summer camp however was meant for children year 3 through year 12, so when Soca was 17 and Min was 16, it was Soca's last year at this summer camp. Min could technically come for another year, she was really sad about coming back without Soca. During the year after Soca's last summer camp, they learned about the ISS corps summer youth program. It is for 16-18 year olds, regardless of their school year, as long as they haven't started a baccalaureate program of study (undergraduate degree) yet. Soca and Min both apply and are offered spots in the youth program. 

This is Asoca's final summer before she goes to PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY in GLOBAL POLITICAL HUB CITY, she is now 18. Minka, now 17, still has one more year of school before she is eligible for university. Min and Soca get on a bus that will take them to the ISS MAINTENANCE STATION. On the bus they meet several other teenagers on their way to their first year in the ISS Corps Youth Program: Rhee, Marq, and others. 

## Chapter 2: Week 1: At Home Within History, Home is where the History is, Home Crews and Histories
The bus arrives at the ISS MAINTENANCE STATION and the teens learn their on-site roles as summer youth cadets: participating in work crews to help the ISS MAINTENANCE STATION staff with their duties, working with a science crew to complete a science exploration project, and living with a home crew.  

The youth cadets spend the first week (induction week) choosing their home crew (basically, a residential team that shares kitchen and toilet duties and whose sleeping quarters are interconnected and cooperatively built) via a REX-like process (REX == Residential EXploration, MIT process for students to check out dorms and choose where to live via a lottery). Each home crew displays their engineering and team working prowess by spending this first week hosting fun activities, meals (which are shared together with all home crews together; each home crew takes 2 meals over the course of the week to show off their collective food making prowess), and renovating their home structures to accommodate new youth cadets, based on the number of youth cadets in the crew graduated the previous year from the youth program. New youth cadets are given temporary sleeping structures for the first week, and are expected to wander from home crew to home crew, getting to know them, checking out their aesthetics and personalities, working with them, hanging out with them. New cadets usually find a home crew within the first few days and end up finishing the building of their own sleeping structures. 

The home crews at the ISS MAINTENANCE STATION: 
- CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE: They are generally preoccupied with circus and theatrical storytelling, bodily morphologies/anatomies/physiologies, and how thought and movement are connected. They like to build aquariums, terrariums, and playgrounds for humans of all sizes. Their home structures are kinetic and encourage daily training. 
- CYBERPHILIA: generally preoccupied with technologically-mediated communication, control, and governance. Lovers of robotics, AI, and automated processes. They like to build wired and wireless networks, tinker heavily with electronics, and play lots of video games (historical console/PC games, VR/AR games, simulator room games). 
- MENDELEEVERS: generally preoccupied with using simple old-fashioned methods and techniques from chemistry, physics, and traditional hand crafts to build both beautiful and practical art and devices. They like to play "what if...in space?", in which a situation is invented in which something breaks out in space, and no internet is available, and very few technologically optimized tools are available, and thus one must macgyver a solution using un-networked, pre-digital tech tools. 
- INFRADESTRUCTORS: preoccupied with understanding the basic facilities, services, and installations needed for the healthy functioning of a society or organization, and with "un-black-boxing" these facilities, services, and installations (meaning that they want to know how things like plumbing, electricity, sewage systems, etc work, and then they want to modify these systems and document these systems well enough that other people can play/hack with them). 

To help the cadets plan their science exploration projects, during the first 2 weeks of the summer program everyone gets a refresher course on history and mission of the ISS Corps (it's meant to be taught by different lecturers each year, to give different perspectives on the history and highlight different details based on the lecturer's focus/interests). The mission of the ISS Corps is to ensure mutually benefitial exchange of knowledge and resources between Earth and Space. This mission includes providing a "unique learning experience to the youth of our planetary community", in order to keep the knowledge and wisdom of this endeavor alive for future generations. 

This sequence of in-story lectures incorporates the theoretical background for my thesis: validation of experimental paradigms across species and environments. "Historical" points to cover: 
- Early Neuroscience (1960s-2020s)
  - dominant theoretical framework: open causal loop (environmental input -> transform function inside the brain -> motor output)
  - much early excitement and energy with many innovations, progress started to slow towards the end of this era
  - challenged by lack of diversity in model organisms and low complexity of worlds tested in laboratories
- towards the end of this first era...
  - developed modular building blocks for complex laboratory worlds
  - developed reactive programming structures and more human-friendly visual languages to coordinate and integrate those modular building blocks
  - increasing popularity of cephalopods for scientific inquiry (due to general growing interest in oceans and their relevance as an environment for understanding space as an environment) and their case for convergent evolution of intelligent behaviour (also relevant to how we think about alient intelligence). 
  
## Chapter 3: Week 2: CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE
Asoca and Minka end up joining the CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE home crew. 

A continuation of the "History of the ISS Corps": 
- A alternative theory slowly but surely pushes it's way to dominance: perceptual control theory 
  - as internet and mobile technologies make clear how effectively technology can manipulate minds, perceptual control theory is resurrected multiple times after it's origin with Norbert Wiener and Cybernetics. 
  - William T Powers, "Behavior: the Control of Perception"

Marken, ["You Say You Had a Revolution: Methodological Foundations of Closed-Loop Psychology"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232499797_You_Say_You_Had_a_Revolution_Methodological_Foundations_of_Closed-Loop_Psychology): TEST FOR CONTROLLED VARIABLES and Field Neuroscience methodology
  - Ehud Ahissar, Eldad Assa, ["Perception as a closed-loop convergence process"](https://elifesciences.org/articles/12830)
- A shift in focus: General Principles of Nervous Systems
  - Knows versus Unknowns quadrants
  - levels of integration in biology
  - What can we learn about brains by studying the movements of bodies?
- "Modern Neuroscience" at the ISS Corps: 
  - Field Neuroscience, which verify our standards for humane experimental technique, the ethological validity of laboratory experiments, and the generalizability of neural phenomena
  - Space Neuroscience, which seeks to understand how brains function off-planet and in long-term low gravity environments
  - Educational Neuroscience, which applies neuroscience research to the development of new pedagogical techniques and didactic strategies

## Chapter 4: Weeks 3 and 4: The Cuttle Shuttle. 
Many youth cadets share an appreciation (some might say obsession) with cephalopods. The previous year's summer program and year-long interns had done an intensive observation study of freely-swimming cuttlefish in an environment where they can hunt "robotic prey" (Cuttle Shuttle), and they now want to analyze the video and figure out how to apply the movement stabilization that cuttlefish achieve during tentacle shots to human space swimming techniques. Soca had learned about cuttlefish during an internship that past year, and had shared her excitement over them with Min. They both decide to join the Cuttle Shuttle project.  

The first challenge that must be solved is to define the tentacle shot pattern in a way that a computer can understand. The next challenge is to teach a computer to reliably track an animal that is evolved to actively camouflage against predators that rely on visual tracking. These will be the goals of the summer youth cadets.

Once the automated tracking allows the crew to have standardized video clips of every tentacle shot recorded in the video dataset, the next challenge is to decide how to visualize, find, and interpret patterns found within these video clips. The final challenge would be to then translate the movement patterns from cuttlefish in water to human bodies in outer space. The interns on the Cuttle Shuttle project plan to complete this step during the year. 

### note: how ISS Corps apprenticeships work
Any youth cadet who completes the summer program is eligible for an internship. However, youth cadets must also be recommended by their home crews. Interns are automatically accepted into next year's summer program, and are required to complete another summer program in order to continue as an intern. Interns who are over 18 and thus are too old to participate in the next summer program are eligible to apply to be an apprentice with the ISS Corps, a 4-year program that can replace standard university baccalaureate credentials. 

## Chapter 5: Goodbye...or not! 
Soca and Min's home crew invite Soca, Min, and Rhee to stay for the 1-year internship. Soca and Min return to their respective homes to consider their options. Min is immediately enthusiastic about the internship. Soca spends a lot of time thinking about it, then decides to defer starting university for one year in order to do the internship with Min. 

During the first six months of the internship they are taught an overview of resource life-cycles in an ISS Corps maintenance station, in addition to the following topics: History of the ISS and the Space Shuttle program, Philosophy of Science and Engineering, Space Swimming, and Basic electronics and machine shop training. Everyone must also pick one more course from the following offerings: Exo-farming, Exo-architecture, Design and Construction of Space Shuttles. Soca chooses Exo-architecture, Min chooses Design and Construction of Space Shuttles. Soca meets Urban Planner, who is on the teaching staff for Exo-architecture while coordinating renovations for the ISS. Min meets Lead Engineer, who is on the teaching staff for Design and Construction of Space Shuttles. Min has some provocative views about government funded research (greatly inspired by her father) that put her at odds with Lead Engineer. 

During this first half of the internship, Soca and Min are also continuing work on the Cuttle Shuttle. They are collaborating with Atehban, an intern from the CYBERPHILIA crew. 

## Chapter 6: Surprising Minds
During the second half of the year long internship, Soca and Min decide to use outdated or recycled space shuttle cameras and monitors to build interactive exhibits that teach the public about the ISS corps mission and day-to-day activities. They collaborate with Adi and Zalo from the CIRQUE DU COSMIQUE crew, and also Haziv and Clavel from the INFRADESTRUCTORS crew. 

They install their first exhibit at the science museum in Soca's hometown, where she first learned about cuttlefish. Min also decides that she doesn't want to go to university and instead wants to join the ISS Corps. She needs to take Theories of Science and Engineering during the second half of her internship if she wishes to become an ISS Corps apprentice. Min also needs to present a proposal for autodidatic study by the end of her internship, which is her "application" for the ISS Corps. 

## Chapter 7: Into the Future
It's the end of the internship, and Min gives her presentation, which are the beginnings of the [VIRS principles and guidelines](http://www.danbeekim.org/projects/2018/02/28/VIRS-principles/). Soca writes a manifesto on the "Social Responsibilities of the Intellectually Privileged, with an especial focus on those who build infrastructure" with Urban Planner, and heads off to university.
