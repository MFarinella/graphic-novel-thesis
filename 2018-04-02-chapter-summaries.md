## How to fit my research projects into the plot
During the summer youth program, all "youth cadets" conduct a science exploration. Minka and Asoca choose to study cuttlefish hunting behaviour ([**Cuttle Shuttle**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/cuttlefish-hunting-behavior/)) in order to develop new space swimming techniques based on flexible scaling of the timing of movements ([**Movement control**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/movement-control-across-timescales/)), especially for rapid stabilization in zero-G environments. 

Youth cadets that excel during the summer program are invited to spend a 1-year apprenticeship with the ISS corps, during which they learn how to maintain the shuttles and present a project exploring the life cycle of resources used to build and maintain space shuttles. Minka and Asoca become apprentices and use outdated or recycled space shuttle cameras and monitors to build interactive exhibits that teach the public about the ISS corps mission and day-to-day activities ([**Surprising Minds**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/surprising-minds-brighton/)). 

During that year, Asoca meets Urban Planner and by the end of Asoca's apprenticeship they co-write a short manifesto on the "Social Responsibilities of the Intellectually Privileged, with an especial focus on those who build infrastructure" ([**Philosophy and Ethics**](http://www.danbeekim.org/open-lab-notebook/scientific-philosophy-ethics/)). Also during that year, Minka meets Lead Engineer and they both get very bad first impressions of each other. During the second half of the apprenticeship, all apprentices wishing to stay with the ISS corps instead of going to a university for baccalaureate certification are required to take courses on the ISS corps's Theories of Science and Engineering ([**Theoretical Puzzle Pieces**](http://www.danbeekim.org/brainplay/2018-02-02-theoretical-puzzle-pieces/)). Minka takes these courses and through the class discussions realizes that Lead Engineer shares some of her most fundamental values. 

# Chapters

## Chapter 1
Minka and Asoca meet at the transport hub nearest to the ISS MAINTENANCE STATION, where they will be spending the summer as part of the ISS Corps Youth Program. They are old friends, having spent the last 6 summers together, though they live very far from each other. Asoca and Minka met each other at a summer camp for creative learning. Asoca had been going to this summer camp since she was 8. Minka didn't start coming to this camp until she was 11, at a time when Asoca was 13. Min and Soca, as they were called, became fast friends during the 4 weeks of their first summer together.

This summer camp however was meant for children year 3 through year 12, so when Soca was 17 and Min was 15, it was Soca's last year at this summer camp. Min could technically come for another year (though she's 2 years younger, because she skipped a grade she's only one year behind Soca in school), she was really sad about coming back without Soca. During the year after Soca's last summer camp, they learned about the ISS corps summer youth program. It is for 16-18 year olds, regardless of their school year, as long as they haven't started a baccalaureate program of study (undergraduate degree) yet. Soca and Min both apply and are offered spots in the youth program. 

This is Asoca's final summer before she goes to PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY in GLOBAL POLITICAL HUB CITY. Minka still has one more year of school before she is eligible for university. Min and Soca get on a bus that will take them to the ISS MAINTENANCE STATION. On the bus they meet several other teenagers on their way to the ISS Corps Youth Program. 

## Chapter 2 
The bus arrives at the ISS MAINTENANCE STATION and the youth cadets are assigned their sleeping quarters, which are selected randomly in order to encourage intermixing between the youth cadets. During induction week they learn that they will be doing 2 things that summer: participating in work crews to help the ISS MAINTENANCE STATION staff with their duties, and working in groups to complete a science exploration project. 

To help the cadets plan their science exploration projects, the first week of the summer program is an intensive course on the history and mission of the ISS Corps. The mission of the ISS Corps is to ensure mutually benefitial exchange of knowledge and resources between the planet-side population and those working and living on the ISS. This mission includes providing a "unique learning experience to the youth of our planetary community", in order to keep the knowledge and wisdom of this endeavor alive for future generations. 

This sequence of in-story lectures incorporates the theoretical background for my thesis: validation of experimental paradigms across species and environments. "Historical" points to cover: 
- Early Neuroscience (1960s-2020s)
  - dominant theoretical framework: open causal loop (environmental input -> transform function inside the brain -> motor output)
  - much early excitement and energy with many innovations, progress started to slow towards the end of this era
  - challenged by lack of diversity in model organisms and low complexity of worlds tested in laboratories
  - developed modular building blocks for complex laboratory worlds
  - developed reactive programming structures and more human-friendly visual languages to coordinate and integrate those modular building blocks
  - increasing popularity of cephalopods for scientific inquiry and their case for convergent evolution of intelligent behaviour
  
## Chapter 3
A continuation of the "History of the ISS Corps": 
- A alternative theory slowly but surely pushes it's way to dominance: perceptual control theory 
  - as internet and mobile technologies make clear how effectively technology can manipulate minds, perceptual control theory is resurrected multiple times after it's origin with Norbert Wiener and Cybernetics. 
  - William T Powers, "Behavior: the Control of Perception"
  - Richard S. Marken, ["You Say You Had a Revolution: Methodological Foundations of Closed-Loop Psychology"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232499797_You_Say_You_Had_a_Revolution_Methodological_Foundations_of_Closed-Loop_Psychology): TEST FOR CONTROLLED VARIABLES and Field Neuroscience methodology
  - Ehud Ahissar, Eldad Assa, ["Perception as a closed-loop convergence process"](https://elifesciences.org/articles/12830)
- A shift in focus: General Principles of Nervous Systems
  - Knows versus Unknowns quadrants
  - levels of integration in biology
  - What can we learn about brains by studying the movements of bodies?
- "Modern Neuroscience" at the ISS Corps: 
  - Field Neuroscience, which verify our standards for humane experimental technique, the ethological validity of laboratory experiments, and the generalizability of neural phenomena
  - Space Neuroscience, which seeks to understand how brains function off-planet and in long-term low gravity environments
  - Educational Neuroscience, which applies neuroscience research to the development of new pedagogical techniques and didactic strategies

## Chapter 4
All youth cadets must participate in a science exploration project. One of the projects available was called the "Cuttle Shuttle". Soca had learned about cuttlefish during an internship that past year, and had shared her excitement over them with Min. They both decide to join the Cuttle Shuttle project. This chapter incorporates all of the details of the data collection and analysis pipeline for the Cuttle Shuttle video dataset, and discusses possible interpretations for the Tentacle Shot Pattern (this is where Movement Control Across Different Timescales comes in). 

## Chapter 5
Soca and Min are invited to stay for a 1-year internship. Soca decides to defer starting university for one year in order to do the internship with Min. During the first six months of the internship they are taught an overview of resource life-cycles in an ISS Corps maintenance station, in addition to the following topics: History of the ISS and the Space Shuttle program, Philosophy of Science and Engineering, Space Swimming, and Basic electronics and machine shop training. Everyone must also pick one more course from the following offerings: Exo-farming, Exo-architecture, Design and Construction of Space Shuttles. Soca chooses Exo-architecture, Min chooses Design and Construction of Space Shuttles. Soca meets Urban Planner, who is on the teaching staff for Exo-architecture while coordinating renovations for the ISS. Min meets Lead Engineer, who is on the teaching staff for Design and Construction of Space Shuttles. Min has some provocative views about government funded research that put her at odds with Lead Engineer. 

## Chapter 6
During the second half of the year long internship, Soca and Min decide to use outdated or recycled space shuttle cameras and monitors to build interactive exhibits that teach the public about the ISS corps mission and day-to-day activities. They install their first exhibit at the science museum in Soca's hometown, where she first learned about cuttlefish. Min also decides that she doesn't want to go to university and instead wants to join the ISS Corps. She is told that she needs to take Theories of Science and Engineering during the second half of her internship if she wishes to go into the ISS Corps without going to university. Min also needs to present a proposal for autodidatic study by the end of her internship, as her "application" for the ISS Corps. 

## Chapter 7
It's the end of the internship, and Min gives her presentation, which are the beginnings of the [VIRS principles and guidelines](http://www.danbeekim.org/projects/2018/02/28/VIRS-principles/). Soca writes a manifesto on the "Social Responsibilities of the Intellectually Privileged, with an especial focus on those who build infrastructure" with Urban Planner, and heads off to university.
