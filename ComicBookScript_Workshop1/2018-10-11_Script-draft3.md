"before the Orbiters lived in the sky,"

"before we hid underground to survive The Burning,"

"we all lived together, on the Earth's surface."

"We could all breathe the air,"

"drink the water,"

**"2066: São Paulo, Brazil"**

**"It was a day of hope and wonder."** 

**"The Space Consortium had just announced the completion of their third space farm, **THE UPPER ESTATES SPACE ARBORETUM**. The news feeds were drowning in photos of the ribbon-cutting event up in orbit, of beautiful, important people draped in gorgeously fashionable and unspeakably expensive formal attire, eSyrup fabric programmed to fluidly change colours in response to the lights, the music, their wearers' moods..."**

**"...of delicate, mouth-watering hors d'oeuvres made from the succulent crops grown and cultivated at the two older space farms, with their carefully filtered water and pristine soil..."**

**"...of the fleet of orbiting home pods that synchronised their velocities with the new arboretum in order to snag front row seats to this historic moment, when humanity proved its ingenuity once more..."**

**"...for the world was becoming too dirty, too extreme in its weather, to support industrial planetside farming..."**

**"...and many people, on this historic day of hope and wonder, were starving..."**

Under this narration, we see Majhee walking briskly through the crowded streets of São Paulo. Everyone is wearing what looks like light-weight full-body hazmat suits, flickering a bit as the eSyrup in the material absorbs dangerous radiation in the air, hoods up, breathing masks and googles on. The air is hazy with smog, the sky a smeared grey-blue, the mid-morning sun pale. As Majhee passes shops and cafes, the daily news appears in hologram-like projections that occupy the ceilings or hover at standing-head-height. Other humans have tiny projections coming from subdermally implanted chips in their wrists, palms, ears, or foreheads; these projections surround their wrists, palms, ears, or face with a sphere of light, either sonifying or visualising entertainment, memories, mental models, dreams, news, scholarly publications. 

A lot of the news is about the new space arboretum, but a few mention the new research base recently established on Mars, and most of the individual **INFO-SPHERE**s are focused on news about planetside climate disasters: 
* The Colorado River has dried up completely and the severe drought is causing mass migrations to east, causing massive overcrowding in major inland ("mid-western") cities.
* Last year's total evaporation of the River Niger has heightened ethnic tensions in the area and armed conflict is escalating.
* An extremely aggressive water-borne disease wipes out several major urban areas in China and India 
* Illnesses from sun radiation, such as skin cancer, have a thousand-fold jump in rate of diagnosis around the world.

*(cite the above news stories)*

### Page 2

We see Majhee walk past a large research facility, metal and glass architecture dully gleaming in the smoggy light, labeled "Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública". The front of the research facility is teeming with protesters, who hold signs and wave flags with slogans like "Não sirva aos tiranos em órbita!", "Educar crianças humanas, não máquinas corporativas!", and "Alimentar humanos não foguetes!" *(need to put translations of these phrases in footnotes)*

Majhee sneaks into an alleyway to enter the research facility via a back door. We see a receptionist sitting behind a sealed glass window. Next to him is a decontamination chamber that all must pass thru in order to enter the research facility. 

Receptionist: **"Dr. Suh! How bad is it out there?"**

Majhee takes off her hood and googles and we see her face - pretty and youthful for her 37 years, if it weren't for the lines of worry and grim determination on her face. She shakes out her hair, cropped short in a bowl pixie cut. Clearly burdened with many troubles, she begins taking off her eSyrup hazmat suit.  

Majhee: **"Still crowded."**

Receptionist: **"Idiots. Don't they understand we're trying to help?"**

Majhee: **"Well, they're hungry. Can't think when you're hungry."**

Majhee removes her boots and steps into the decontamination chamber.

### Page 3

Majhee stands in her office, seemingly floating in the center of a giant transparent bacteria made of light. The light model of the bacteria is exquisitely detailed, and a section of the nucleoid is blown up for closer inspection. Majhee's fingers are raised in a well-practiced yet complicated gesture. Her face is darkened with barely contained rage. 

Off panel: **"Majhee, you can't *scoop* the *Space Consortium*..."**

Majhee: **"For the last time, Marcia, it's not scooping if I'm making everything freely accessible!"**

We see Marcia Netto, President of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, in Majhee's doorway, rubbing her forehead with exasperation.

Marcia: **"You know what I mean. They are *determined* to make money off eSyrup applications, and when you post your lab's developments online under a Creative Commons license, you make that application of eSyrup tech *unpatentable*."**

Majhee: **"Exactly."**

Marcia: **"But you saw what they did with after our collaboration to develop eSyrup fuel! This institute cannot afford another round of legal action like that!"**

### Page 4

Majhee angrily turns off the giant bacteria of light with an impatient gesture as she turns to Marcia, furious.

Majhee: **"*You* pushed that collaboration through, against my numerous objections!"** 

Marcia, immediately apologetic, hands up to ward off Majhee's anger

Marcia: **"I know, I *know*, that was definitely my mistake, and I'm *sorry*."**

Majhee interrupts: **"And stop talking like you actually *believe* in propriatary health research! How is it possible that *anyone* can still hold such *archaic* views?"**

Marcia, defeated: **"*sigh*. Just...be careful."** 

Marcia looks over her shoulder, then turns back to Majhee.

Marcia, low and careful: **"There are rumors that the Space Consortium is trying to *weaponize* eSyrup. I know I sound like a conspiracy theorist, but..."**

Majhee, incredulous: **"They wouldn't dare--"**

Felix, a scientist in Majhee's lab, appears at the doorway, breathless and distraught.

Felix: **"Majhee, my father-- President Netto!"**

Majhee: **"I'm sorry Marcia, we'll have to continue this another time."**

### Page 5

Majhee, Felix, and other members of Majhee's research group sit or stand in a cluster at one end of their lab benches in an upper floor of the research institute. The wall nearest to them is a floor-to-ceiling window, showing the dusty sky-line of São Paulo. The sun sits in a reddish hazy sky, just past the midday zenith. 

Majhee: **"So. Your father has been diagnosed again."**

The circle of researchers: **Felix Grael**, a pale but handsome man in his late 20s, raised in Rio de Janeiro by Swedish immigrants who have since returned to Europe, his face lined with fear and sadness, head in hands as his elbows rest on his knees; **Kai Oliveira**, a much older woman of Japanese-Portuguese descent, grey-haired and hook-nosed, stern-faced and sitting stiffly in her chair; **Beatriz Cavalcanti**, a tall woman in her 30s, a Brazilian of Italian descent, mouth set in a grim line even as her hands squeeze Felix's shoulders in a motherly, comforting gesture; **Breno Leite**, a dark, thin man in his early 30s, born and raised in the streets of São Paulo by his young Brazilian single mother, who worked every day of her life before falling ill in order to send her son to university; **Nova Jatobá**, a young graduate student in her mid-20s, descended from indiginous Brazilians from deeper inland, her plump face lined with exhaustion; **Iara Gracie**, another young grad student in her mid-20s, who was born into an old Brazilian martial arts family but chose the life of a scientist instead; **Vec Barbosa**, a portly Brazilian man of West African descent in his 40s, hands resignedly folded over a substantial beer belly, face troubled and sad behind a rather bushy yet neatly-trimmed beard.

Vec, to Felix: **"Beatriz and I have already contacted your father's medical team in Sweden, and we've given them access to our database on repeat skin cancer patients. This will greatly improve his chances of recovery, but..."**

Beatriz, kindly: **"We also remember that your father had a liver transplant last year. If you want to go home to be with your family, everyone will understand."**

Felix now looks up, straight at Majhee, eyes full of furious determination.

Felix: **"There's nothing I can do there anyway...besides, we need to finish the biofilm project! *Before* Space Consortium can get their filthy hands on another patent!"**

Felix covers his face with his hands, furious at the tears that have started to stream down his face.

Beatriz: **"I'm sure we could manage--"**

Kai, arms folded, looking down at her lap with hard eyes.

Kai: **"We can't finish this project in time without Felix. We all know splicing's more art than algorithm, and ever since my hands starting hurting too much, Felix is our *best*."**

Kai's brow furrows with frustration. 

Kai: **"Although...our best may not be enough...Space Consortium announced a few days ago their eSyrup-spliced [halobacterium solar cell](cen.acs.org/energy/solar-power/Organic-solar-cell-smashes-performance/96/web/2018/08), and thus, just patented all eSyrup-based solar cells. Also, this morning I got *this*."** 

Kai passes up a small card to Majhee. Majhee reads from it.

Majhee: **"'You've been slapped on the wrists. Don't make us go for your throat.'"**

Nova, looking terrified: **"What's that supposed to mean??"**

Kai: **"Space Consortium's telling us to stop competing with them. Suing us for exclusive patents on eSyrup fuel was the slap on the wrists."**

### Page 6

Everyone takes a moment to imagine what it might be like if Space Consortium went for their throats. 

Iara: **"My grandfather called this morning...he told me he was offered 10 billian reais last week to convince me to report our unpublished work."**

Felix: **"What??"**

Iara: **"Apparently that wasn't the first time either...he got a similar offer last year as well, but he thought it wasn't worth mentioning because he knew I wouldn't go for it."**

Nova, aghast: **"10 billion reais...that's more than the institute's endowment..."** 

Breno: **"It's worth it. A stable splice with a bacterial colony is the first step towards splicing eSyrup with human cells, and if Space Consortium can manage to patent living splices, they'll have a monopoly on all future clinical and medical applications of eSyrup."**

We see Breno's moody, cynical eyes. 

Breno: **"But I'm sure 10 billion is nothing to a trust-fund baby like you, Iara..."**

Felix: **"Come on Breno! You know *none* of us would sell-out to Space Consortium!"**

Breno, smiles ruefully, eyes pitying: **"Really? That kind of money would give my mother the same quality of treatment that your father gets for free in Sweden. What makes you think I wouldn't give in to a temptation like that?"**

Felix: **"Well then good thing Majhee is paying the doctors' bribes for your mother, yeah?! If Iara is privileged, then so are you!"**

We see the circle of researchers sitting in silence, betraying varying degrees of discomfort and fear.

### Page 7 

Majhee: **"I can't...*ask* anyone to stay. We all know the risks that come with working on this project, with working in this city right now. We all have family to protect."**

Majhee: **"But...*personally*...I can't give up now. If we don't get these eSyrup protocols into the public domain, many will suffer because they can't pay Space Consortium's price."**

Majhee: **"If you feel you must leave, I will do what I can to help you and your family get out of this city, and off Space Consortium's radar."**

Majhee: **"If you stay...I will forever owe you a debt of gratitude...and I swear, I will protect you and your families in any way that I can."**

**"6 months later: Massachusetts, USA"**

We see rolling countryside, vibrant with autumn colors, behind a low row of concrete warehouses, labeled "Morei Textiles". 

Off-panel, secretary: **"Iúna, the folks from the World Health Organization are here."**

Off-panel, Iúna: **"Thanks, I'll be with them in a moment."**

We see the inside of a warehouse, where long rows of industrial looms weave eSyrup textiles. Their combined activity generates a gently deafening **"WHIRRRRR"**. Iúna Morei, a tall shapely American woman of Portuguese descent in her early 30s, lustrous wavy brown hair pulled up into a bun, an infant with thick black hair strapped to her front, walks briskly and confidently away from a door labeled "Quiet Room" towards a group of humans waiting near the main entrance of the warehouse. 

Iúna smiles and yells as she waves towards her office door, just next to the entrance to the warehouse and labeled "Iúna Morei, CEO of Morei Textiles".

Iúna: **"HELLO! SHALL WE STEP INTO MY OFFICE?"**

### Page 8

Iúna: **"Thank you for bringing the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols from São Paulo."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"You know, you'd get these updates a lot faster if you'd just get an **INFO-SPHERE** mod..."**

Iúna: **"Dr. Kauffmann, I'm sure your colleagues can tell you how adamantly opposed I am to body modifications and eSyrup implants. I'm extremely grateful that you've taken the time to travel all the way from DC today."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Well, we were in Boston for an emergency conference, so it wasn't too much trouble. Besides, no one can beat your MERV filter efficiency ratings, not with sheer fabrics at least. I've got your organzas in every window of my house."**

Iúna: **"Just doing what we can. What was the emergency conference about?"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"They're preparing themselves for a huge wave of refugees."**

Iúna: **"Really? From where?"**

Under this dialogue is a view of Iúna's desk. We see sneak peek's of the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols visualized with light, a floating sphere controlled by a thick piece of eSyrup canvas, stretched on a semi-circular frame that, when Iúna stands inside of it, places the canvas at about hip height, easy to reach while standing. Either one large image or many very close-up views. 

### Page 9

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Didn't you hear? A police raid in L.A. this morning started a huge fire that's spread halfway up the coast of California. It's so big it's getting blown over the mountains into Arizona by high winds. Everything out there is bone dry ever since the Colorado River disappeared."**

Iúna: **"What?? How many dead??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Unfortunately we haven't had a chance to count yet. Thousands are already homeless."**

Iúna: **"How does a police raid start a state-wide fire??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"It's all the plastic furniture - they're basically *solid* petroleum, turns a misplaced candle into a fireball in just *minutes*. And LA to San Francisco is so packed with cheap cookie-cutter homes, in retrospect, I'm amazed this didn't happen sooner. I'm sorry, I should have realised you wouldn't have heard yet...do you know anyone over there?"**

Iúna: **"Yes, I...I'm sorry I need to make a call..."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Of course. We'll see ourselves out."**

Under this dialogue we see close-up views of the baby strapped to Iúna's front. The child is a little less than one year old. The strapping is an intricately folded piece of eSyrup cloth that can amplify the baby's heartrate, breathing, and digestive sounds. 

### Page 10

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, have you been able to contact Joshua Tree?*"**

Iúna is outside, and her baby is no longer strapped to her chest. Instead, her face is covered in a thick veil and she wears what looks like a heavy, full-sleeved and full-length apron. eSyrup circuits flash within the weave of both Iúna's veil and apron. She stands, facing west, arms flung out wide, back straight and tall, legs apart, boots planted wide in the frosty grass. 

Iúna's Biononymous contact at Green Haven Tahoe: **"*Negative, Mama Bird.*"**

Iúna: **"*How is Tahoe?*"**

Tahoe: **"*Fire hasn't gotten further than Fresno, but we're getting ready to offer sanctuary.*"**

Iúna: **"*So...it *was* the body mod.*"**

Tahoe: **"*Looks like it. They didn't even bother going for the decoy.*"**

### Page 11

Iúna ponders for a moment, her face furrowed with grief and concentration.

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, I've changed my mind. I vote for registering as a religion.*"**

Tahoe: **"*Wa-wait, seriously?*"**

Iúna: **"*Yes. We need all of the protections we can get right now.*"**

Tahoe: **"*You've been thinking about what Pigsah said at our last TeleSensing?*"**

Iúna: **"*Yes. They were right - it's relatively easy right now to live without body mods. But once all the schools require every student to get an **INFO-SPHERE** mod, once every industry requires employees to use body mods in order to be qualified for the job...our children **won't** have a choice. They'll have to list their body mods on their CV, you just won't be a qualified human *adult* if you don't have a body mod.*"**

Tahoe: **"*But...declaring ourselves a religion...it just feels like we're setting ourselves up for all the pitfalls of a *cult*.*"**

Iúna: **"*I know, and that's why I intially voted against it. But if we want defend our right to live without constant surveillance, we can't just empower individual decisions without thinking about how to co-exist with the rest of society. If we don't take drastic measures, in just 10 years our social structures will make it *impossible* to live without constant surveillance.*"**

### Page 12

Tahoe: **"*But we still haven't figured out our own solutions to the really *practical* advantages of body mods...long-distance communication, ways to aid our memories and gain perspective on our behaviour...*"**

Iúna: **"*That's why I've changed my mind. Our eSyrup research needs to expand, and it needs to stay under the radar. Tahoe, do you know what that research group in Brazil published last month?*"**

Tahoe: **"*What?*"**

Iúna: **"*The first successful splice of eSyrup with a living organic compound, a recipe for creating eSyrup *biofilm*!*"**

Tahoe: **"*...Sorry Mama Bird, I don't follow eSyrup research like you do. Why should I care about biofilm?*"**

Iúna: **"*Because that's the *beginning*. Those bastards managed it before Space Consortium, got it published before Space Consortium could patent it. Do you remember how we once talked of synthetic companion creatures, that can act like portable, non-invasive **INFO-SPHERES**?*"**

Tahoe: **"*...yes...?*"**

Iúna: **"It's possible now. *If they can splice eSyrup with a microcolony of bacteria, then we can figure out how to splice eSyrup into bigger, more complex living things. And if creating and interacting with these creatures is part of our religious practice...*"**

Iúna: **"*...then we have much stronger grounds to deny oversight by Space Consortium, or any national government!*"**

### Page 1

**"2067: Ushuaia, Argentina"**

We see a bustling harbour town, everything about it small and cute except for the occassional warehouse factory or modern high rise office building - these were clearly very recent additions to a place that otherwise hadn't changed very much in many hundreds of years.

**"When growing a personal supply of eSyrup, say, for research or for fun, you can feed it enough silica just by running down to the beach once a week with a soup bowl."**

**"Industrialized eSyrup production, however, needs quite a bit of silica."**

**"Sand mining was out of the question, given the Space Consortium's concern with their image - wouldn't want their brand tarnished by news of their operations destroying delicate coastal ecosystems or picturesque beachside communities."**

**"So they turned to the next biggest source of biogenic silica - deep-sea deposits in the [Antarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenic_silica#Major_silica_sinks_in_the_modern_oceans)."**

We see close-ups of the [wildlife at Cabo de Hornos](https://youtu.be/06LcgVQg7Yk) with tumultuous ocean and raw, mountainous landscape. Off in the distance, we see a tiny speck on the horizon - a deep-sea silica mining rig. A tiny plume of smoke, looking both innocent and foreboding, curls up from the rig. 

### Page 2

**"Ocean Acidification Monitoring Station, Roca Redonda, Galapagos Islands"**

Researchers stare in horror at the read-outs of their remote monitoring systems, displayed using a room-sized **INFO-SPHERE**. A hurricane rages outside. 

Technician: **"Dr. Zambrano! Dr. Zambrano!"**

Dr. Zambrano, already looking harried, sticks their head into the room. 

Dr. Zambrano: **"What is it?"**

Tech: **"The pH levels at the ocean's surface...do you see...because of the rain!!"**

Dr.Zambrano: **"Dios mío...we've slipped down to 8.0..."**

*Cite [this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rising-acidity-in-the-ocean/).*

### Page 3

**"Thermohaline Circulation Observation Centre, Orkney Islands"**

Dr. Fischmann: **"Members of the UN, thank you for your time today. My name is Dr. Geraldine Fischmann, and I'm head of environmental monitoring team for the Thermohaline Circulation Observation Collective. The TCOC has been tracking the temperature, salinity, and flow rates of the major ocean currents in the North Atlantic Ocean for the last 40 years, and we think we have an explanation for recent drop in energy production by the UN-deployed sea turbines."**

A room-sized **INFO-SPHERE** creates photonic representations of several government leaders around the world. Dr. Fischmann, a tall, hook-nosed woman with incredibly built thighs walks through a 3-dimensional video recording of rivers and waterfalls *pouring* off of a glacier into the fjords surrounding it. Overlayed with light are labels with meta data and more in-depth treatments of certain phenomena being shown in the video, appearing when one of the photonic representations of government leaders move their gaze over that part of the video. 

Dr. Fischmann: **"These videos are from 15 years ago, when intensely hot global temperatures caused a significant meltdown of the Greenland Ice Sheet. As you all well remember, this drastic phenomena finally convinced the United States and China to place a meaningful tax on carbon dioxide emissions, and members of the Paris Agreement switched to [marine current power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_current_power) for electricity generation."**

*note: [biggest usage of coal right now is currently for fuel, only 20% is for electricity](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/dangerous-global-warming-will-happen-sooner-than-thought-study)- did the world switch to renewables in time?*

### Page 4

The videos switch to another view of the same glacier, but a slightly different coastline. The glacier isn't melting, and instead, enormous, thick chunks of [drift ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_ice) clog up the sea like a traffic jam. 

Dr. Fischmann: **"This is the current view of the Greenland, from remote sensor buoys in the Denmark Strait. Normally, the [West Ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ice), doesn't extend this far south, but we believe the drastic melting 15 years ago triggered a long-term, slow melting of the ice sheet, one that has been stealthily and steadily dumping massive amounts of fresh water into the Greenland Sea."**

Dr. Fischmann: **"The fresh water freezes more readily than salty sea water, resulting in more ice on the ocean's surface. We believe that this greater incidence of pack ice is extending the West Ice so far south that it may block major ocean currents that run through the Denmark Strait, causing the reduction in electricity generated by the UN's sea turbines."**

Dr. Fischmann: **"[If the ocean currents stop entirely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutdown_of_thermohaline_circulation), the UK and northern Europe may *freeze*."**

*(cite [this article](https://www.wunderground.com/resources/climate/abruptclimate.asp) and [the wikipedia page on thermohaline circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation))*

### Page 5

**"São Paulo, Brazil"**

The orderly protest crowds in front of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública are gone, replaced by utter chaos. Everyone on the street is now wearing industrial filter respirators and knee-length rubber water boots - the streets are ankle-deep in polluted, acidic ocean water. Rain, highly dosed with nitric acid, pours from the sky. We see Majhee, fully dressed in protective gear and a breathing mask, weave her way through a crowd and rush into the front door of the research institute. 

Majhee: *"2 months ago, when an epidemic of [nitrogen dioxide poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide_poisoning)	 landed half of the city in hospitals and on oxygen tanks, Felix and his family moved back to Sweden..."*

Majhee: *"1 month ago, when all the supermarkets started opening just once a week instead of every day, Breno moved with his mother back to her hometown, just north of Brasilia..."*

Majhee: *"11 days ago, hours after we celebrated the birth of Nimh, our first live birth of a mouse spliced with raw eSyrup, Iara was found on a rooftop in Centro, seemingly shot through the skull, but the bullet was never found..."*

### Page 6

Kai, Beatriz, Nova, and Vec are in the same area where they were having a lab meeting, last we saw them - now they are frantically packing lab equipment and eSyrup cultures, and copying research notes then deleting/shredding/destroying them. Off to one side is an unfamiliar older man and a teenaged boy keeping two very young children out of the fray. The teenaged boy looks related to Nova. The two young children look related to the unfamiliar older man and Beatriz, one looking about 6 and the other looking about 3. The little one has short hair, tied into a puffy short ponytail at the very top of her head; the older one has long straight hair that just brushes his shoulders; they both stare at the frantic activity with wide eyes. 

Majhee: **"We need to finish packing up NOW."**

Vec pulls aside Majhee. Vec looks incredibly troubled.  

Vec: **"Majhee, what do we with Nimh??"**

Majhee: **"What's her condition?"**

Vec: **"Her esophogus and trachea. They didn't join properly, there's a leak. I don't think Sonic Hedgehog(cite) is a viable vector, too much depends on it, and the range is too small."**

Majhee: **"What range?"**

Vec: **"Of variation from the normal molecular structure that we can induce on it and *still* end up with a molecule that can do *everything* that Sonic Hedgehog *needs* to do(cite)!!"**

### Page 7

Majhee places a hand on Vec's shoulder to calm him. 

Majhee: **"How big of a leak? Can we patch it?"**

Vec: **"It's thin but *long*, almost the whole length of the connection. Nova wants to try, but Kai and Beatriz think it will take too long, and won't buy us much time anyway."**

Vec looks emotionally wrecked. 

Vec: **"I will help Nova, if you think it's a good idea."**

Majhee stares at the pouring rain outside, the streets below awash with sea water, lost belongings, and garbage. People with insufficient protection from the nitric acid heavy rain are screaming and bleeding. After a long silence, Majhee speaks softly.

Majhee: **"There is no more time left to buy. Even if we fix the leak, how will we transport a dying transgenic mouse through acid rain and flood(cite)?"**

Majhee: **"Give her 20 microliters of Sodium Pentobarbital(cite), and send all of our data to Sweden. Felix will have more time to experiment."**

### Page 8

Majhee turns back to the rest of the room and greets the older man with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He gives Majhee a tired smile. 

Majhee: **"Glad you're here, Demetrio, how are you?"**

Demetrio: **"As well as one can be, given the situation."**

Majhee hugs the teenaged boy. 

Majhee: **"And Amana, are you alright?"**

Amana looks terrified, and nearly crying from the effort of keeping his cool in front of the smaller children. 

Amana: **"Dr. Suh, where are we going?"**

### Page 9

Majhee squats to be eye level with the two little children, and gathers them and Amana around her. Demetrio crouches behind the two little ones and places a comforting hand on the boy's shoulder. Majhee smiles extra brightly at the little girl. 

Majhee: **"Right! Nicola, Nerio, we are going walk *very far*, to a mountain with a *flat top*, like a table! *But*, on the way, the *rain* is *lava*, and the *air* is lava, so we need to keep the lava *off* of our skins, *no matter what*. Do you understand?"**

Nicola squeels and smiles shyly, raising her arms and hiding her face in her father's knee. Nerio nods somber-faced, one hand on his father's other knee. 

Majhee shifts her attention to Amana. 

Majhee: **"Do you remember our last lab retreat, when we all went SCUBA diving? You're gonna come with me to bring the wetsuits up here."**

### Page 10

**"In the year 2067, the safety valves on the Space Consortium's deep-sea silica harvesting rig in the Antarctic failed to activate, spewing partially distilled volcanic fumes and biogenic silica, heavy with silicon tetraflouride, into the southern ocean currents. The disaster belched a huge cloud of hydrogen flouride into the [West Wind Drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current), mixing the highly corrosive gas into an already critically damaged atmosphere, and lowering the pH of an already fatally acidic ocean."**

*In volcanic fumes, [silicon tetrafluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_tetrafluoride) forms [hexafluorosilicic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexafluorosilicic_acid), which can further hydrolyze to [hydroflouric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid).*

**"The poisonous cloud choked and blinded most of the rig's crew, and the hydroflouric acid burned anyone who fell into the ocean. The catastrophe killed 32 people and sank the harvesting rig into the sea. For weeks, the silican tetraflouride plumes belched unchecked into the Antarctic Convergence."**

**"Everyone fled underground, trying to hide from the huge clouds of poisonous gas and acid rain that were sweeping around the globe in terrifyingly large and frequent cyclones."**

On a backdrop of the "Earth as a marble in space" image, showing intense cyclonic activity. Over this backdrop, we see 
* Majhee leading her research team as they get their first glimpse of the [Mato Grasso Plateau](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mato-Grosso-Plateau), all of them completely covered in neoprene and goggles and breathing masks and rubber boots. 
* Iúna and her son João queue in line to beg asylum in caves in Vermont to escape the poisonous atmosphere. They are both well covered in Iúna's best eSyrup textiles. Other people aren't so lucky.

**"Amid the chaos, nearly 60,000 planetside humans fled into orbit on the Space Consortium's Space Barges."**

A huge crowd of desperate people try to shove themselves onto four enormous Space Barges, but it's clear that even these behemoth vessels will not fit everyone in the launch station. The Space Barge launch station staff try to maintain order but everyone is in a hysterical panic. Three of the Space Barges have already closed their doors and are firing up its engines. 

There are nearly 10 additional empty launch pads, but they are all empty. 

Person in the crowd: **"Why aren't the other barges coming back???"**

The last Space Barge begins to close its doors. People totally lose their shit. 

PA: **"Please step away from the safety barrier!! Please step AWAY from the safety barrier!!"**

**"Afraid to take on more refugees than they could safely host in orbit, the Space Consortium shut down the Space Barge shuttle service, 'until further notice'."**

**"That 'further notice' came 2 years later, when the Orbiters returned to Earth to declare themselves, *'The **WORLD GOV**'*."**

## Chapter 3: A Fearful Trill of Things Unknown but Longed for Still

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Eireena McLeland, Serena Ramirez, Fili Jackson

### Page 1

4 jagged panels. 1st POV of running, terrified, through a harsh and rocky landscape. Flash of memory: enormous fangs; cold, blood-red eyes. A farming village in ruins, fires consuming the large interconnected home structures and surrounding greenhouses. Dead bodies, mangled by the monstrous wolf-like creatures that are the size of a small elephant. 

Asoka trips, falling face veil down in the dirt. Their mechapet, a synthetic creature made to look like a cuttlefish and brought alive using eSyrup technology, chitters frantically from where it is wrapped around Asoka's neck, sheet-white with fear. Asoka's clothes are drenched in fear sweat, gloves torn, face veil reflecting a face of terror and horror. Everything is covered in dust and dirt. 

Asoka: *"Mom...I sent...Pippa back...WHY??"*

We see Asoka clench their fist, then throw up their head, struggle to stand, eyes streaming with tears. 

Asoka: *"Must...reach...the next...Haven!"*

### Page 2

**"Earlier that morning..."**

**"2116: Green Haven Howes, North America"**

We see a fist holding a bunch of wheat straws, and another hand reaching for a straw. 

Pippa, off-panel: **"*Aw, *seriously*?*"**

We see a crowd of Biononymous children gathered in a outdoor pavilion with a dirt floor, all wearing the compulsory clothing of their cult: a simple sleeveless shirt tucked into baggy trousers in the style of [shalwar kameez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalwar_kameez); a light long sleeve jacket, loose and fastening up the front, covered in a variety of simple geometric embroidery patterns, sleeves cinched at the wrists; gloves tucked into the sleeves; head veil with identical cartoon schematics of a face embroidered onto each with eSyrup thread; boots, with the trousers tucked in. Each child also has an eSyrup mechapet curled around their arms, legs, necks; sitting on heads, shoulders; or eagerly following their heels. Some of the children have straws of varying lengths in their hands. One child, smaller than the rest of the other children, a mechapet shaped like an American Crow sitting on their shoulder, is holding a very short straw, and the face on their head veil is a definite pout. 

Pippa: **"*I did the far hill field *yesterday*!*"**

Biononymous child holding the fist of straws: **"*Come on Pippa, we all agreed we would pick by straws today.*"**

Pippa: **"*But it's not fair, Io! I'm the smallest, and it's so far away!*"**

Io: **"*We all agreed!*"**

We see tiny gloved hands try to shove the short straw back into an only slightly larger fist of straws. 

Pippa: **"*Take it back, let me pick again!*"**

A taller, lankier Biononymous child, a cuttlefish mechapet curled around their neck, steps in between them and calmly separates them. 

Asoka: **"*Come on, Pippa, I'll help you.*"**

### Page 3

Asoka and Pippa roll two large plastic barrels on a grassy path up a steep, terraced hill, towards a long row of tall greenhouses. The barrels are heavy with water and the two children lean their whole bodies into the endeavor. The cuttlefish mechapet holds two large woven shade-fans over the children's heads, while the crow mechapet moves sticks and other obstacles out of their path. 

Pippa: **"*No, *Soka-aa*, Io was cheating, I know it! They haven't had to work further away than the apple trees ever since we started trying out all of their 'work assignment algorithms'...*"**

Asoka: **"*It's only been a week...maybe you've just had bad luck?*"**

Pippa: **"*Why do *I* always have the bad luck? Can't it go bother someone else sometime?*"**

At the top of the path, slightly above the row of greenhouses, is a row of spigots with hose attachments. Asoka is carefully placing their barrel against a rusted metal barrel holder. Pippa, whose barrel is already placed in a barrel holder, is crouched in front of their barrel, struggles with the hose attachments to their barrel. 

Pippa: **"*These are always so hard to do with gloves...*"**

Asoka gives Pippa a wink and a thumbs up before tending to their own hose attachment.

Asoka: **"*You got this!*"**

### Page 4

Asoka: **"*Wanna know a secret to making your luck better?*"**

Pippa: **"*Yes!*"**

Asoka: **"*Before picking a straw, or rolling dice, think of the worst possible outcome.*"**

Pippa: **"*The worst?!*"**

Asoka: **"*Then think about how you would get what you want even if you had the worst luck, and shout in your head, 'I don't care if the worst happens! I can handle it!!'*"**

### Page 5

Asoka: **"*Then the bad luck gets scared, and knows it can't have fun with you.*"**

The two children watch the water flow through the gravity-powered aquaduct system, gently scattering moisture onto the plants inside the greenhouse. 

Asoka: **"*Smells like Jeshua's making butter buns today...*"**

Pippa looks miserable. 

Pippa: **"*We're so far away, they'll be cold by the time we get back. Why do we have a grove all the way up here anyway?*"**

Asoka smiles kindly via their face veil. 

Asoka: **"*Some of these plants need more sun than they'd get in the valley...*"**

Asoka crouches to be face level with Pippa.

Asoka: **"*If I take care of the weeding, will you run back now and bring me a hot bun?*"**

Pippa beams with joy and gratitude. 

Pippa: **"*Really? Yes!*"**

Pippa runs off, crow mechapet flying overhead. 

Pippa: **"*Thanks Soka! Come on Manut!*"**

### Page 6

Asoka looks at their cuttlefish mechapet, hands resolutely on their hips. 

Asoka: **"*Alright, Iri, let's do this!*"**

Iri chirps with happy determination, holding up weeding trowels in its arms in a celebratory gesture. 

Iri: **"Yeah!"**

Panels show Asoka and Iri weeding the plants in the greenhouse. Have some nice botany spreads of future plants that have been genetically engineered to deal with a heavy NO2 and CO2 content. The plants need to have ways of reducing their overgrowth thanks to the abundance of CO2 and they need to still sequester enough nutrients for them to be worth growing and eating. What do the 3 sisters (beans, corn, squash) need to change in order to still be a great trio?

### Page 7

Asoka: **"*All done!*"**

Asoka wipes their brow. 

Asoka: **"*We must've worked fast if Pippa's still not back--*"**

Suddenly Iri shrieks and goes completely white. Iri begins loudly broadcasting in the generic synthetic voices used by the Biononymous outside the privacy of their home structures. 

Iri: **"*This is an emergency broadcast from Green Haven Howes, we are under attack! Repeat, *WE ARE UNDER ATTACK*--Aaaaaaaaahh!!!---(scream cuts off with a sickening gurgle)*"**

Iri collapses into a grey puddle as Asoka rushes over, face veil revealing their terror. 

Asoka: **"*Attack?!*"**

Asoka scoops up Iri and begins running down the valley, but Iri suddenly re-animates and broadcasts another voice not its own. 

Iri: **"Soka, stay away, don't come back!!"**

Asoka clutches Iri to their chest, looking down the mountainside with terrified eyes at the sight of enormous wolves tearing through their village, aghast to hear...

Asoka: **"*Mom??!!*"**

Iri/Soka's Mom: **"It's the **DEATH DOGS**!! Run Soka! *RUN!!*"**

### Page 8

It's night. A village with a central housing structure identical to Asoka's home village, also surrounded by greenhouses, sleeps tranquilly amongst rolling hills and a soft, nearly full moon. A faint orange glow is visible in one corner of the central housing structure. 

Eireena, off-panel: **"I'm so sorry for your loss, Asoka."**

Inside, Asoka is kneeling, head bowed. They are wearing clean trousers and sleeveless shirt, but their feet, hands, and head are bare. Asoka's long reddish hair is tied back in a half ponytail, and Iri, now displaying a reddish back and cream coloured bottom to better camouflage from its perch on Asoka's neck, peers out from under Asoka's hair. Before Asoka is a large steaming mug of hot tea, but Asoka hasn't touched it. Tears run down their face, past an upper lip that shows just the tiniest hints of fuzzy hair. 

We see Eireena McLeland, High Priestess of the Biononymous and leader of this Green Haven, a tiny woman, silver haired, wrinkled face showing deep sorrow, sitting on a floor cushion and wearing an elaborately embroidered jacket. On either side of her sit two other adult Biononymous: a man and a woman, somewhat younger than Eireena. The man looks at Asoka, his dark face betraying heartbroken sympathy for Asoka and anxious worry about the situation as a whole. The woman's face, half-hidden behind long, thick, gently curling dark hair, is one of calm contemplation. 

They are all sitting inside a warmly lit room with a shrine centered along one wall. All of the walls are covered in tapestries, made with the finest of the Biononymous' textile and embroidery. The shrine is a figure dressed in the religious clothing of the Biononymous, legs folded into a lotus and one hand raised, akin to the Buddha, but instead of holding the palm forward, the wrist is bent and the palm is cupped, just enough to hold a bit of soil and a tiny seedling, just beginning to sprout. In front of the seated figure is a large black bird, carved out of wood and delicately painted, with long legs and a horn-like feather sticking out of its forehead -- a [horned screamer, *Anhima cornuta*](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=horned+screamer+anhima+cornuta&t=opera&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images). The figurine is surrounded by non-combusting eSyrup candles and scent-only eSyrup incense, and early summer blossoms. 

Eireena: **"I don't think any of the Biononymous anticipated that very many other animals would survive The Burning, especially large carnivores...it's quite strange, actually...but we will need to consider how to protect the Green Havens from these '**DEATH DOGS**'."**

### Page 9

The fabric flap to this room opens, and another Biononymous adult enters. He addresses Eireena.

Biononymous man: **"Apologies, High Priestess, but **WORLD GOV** Peacekeepers have just arrived. They request an audience with you immediately."**

The other woman, sitting beside Eireena, raises an eyebrow. Her eye has a hard glint.  

Biononymous woman: **"Immediately? At this indecent hour?"** 

Eireena: **"It's alright, Serena. Charlie, please let the Peacekeepers know I'll be with them shortly."**

Charlie bows and exits. Eireena stands and looks down at Asoka, who is still kneeling with their head down, unable to look up or stand, tears streaming down their face. 

Eireena: **"It seems these days are full of the strange and the indecent. Asoka has sanctuary with us, but perhaps it would be best to keep their presence here...discreet."**

Eireena puts on her face veil. 

Eireena: **"*Fili, please escort Asoka to the infirmary and see to their needs. Serena, please come with me.*"**

Fili and Serena both bow: **"Yes, High Priestess."**

### Page 10

It is the next morning. Asoka sits on the edge of their bed in the infirmary, a thick, sturdy mattress in the style of Japanese futons, on a [tatami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatami)-style floor. Asoka's bare feet are on the tatami, knees bent up under their folded arms, in which they rest their head. Their eyes are tired and puffy. Iri tenderly combs Asoka's hair with its arms. 

Fili pushes back the door tapestry to Asoka's room, carrying a tray of food. Fili is also barefoot and without his face veil or jacket. 

Fili: **"Good morning. Did you sleep at all?"**

Asoka, without looking up, straightens their back and lowers their knees into a cross-legged sitting position. They look too dejected to talk. Iri timidly peers at Fili from around Asoka's hair. 

Iri: **"We slept a little."**

Fili sets down the tray and sits across from Asoka, whose eyes have started to leak tears again. Fili looks at Asoka sadly, then gives a little smile. 

Fili: **"Fresh raspberries? Just picked them this morning."**

Asoka still shows no reaction. Fili's smile drops and he looks down. 

Fili: **"I have a child about your age...I can't imagine them going through what you've gone through...It's ok to feel pain, but please, you must eat. It would dishonour your entire Haven if you were to starve yourself to death."**

Asoka finally looks at Fili. After a moment, Asoka reaches for a raspberry. Fili smiles encouragingly. 

### Page 11

A scratch at the door. Eireena enters with Serena. Fili stands and bows. Asoka also stands, abruptly remembering their manners, and knocks over the raspberries. Asoka looks mortified. 

Asoka: **"Oh no! I'm so sorry!"**

Asoka rushes to pick up the scattered raspberries. Eireena holds up a hand to stop Asoka and smiles wryly as Serena calmly gathers the rest of the raspberries, which mostly scattered in her direction anyway. 

Eireena: **"Please, eat those, and sit."**

Serena returns the raspberries to their bowl, and they all sit, Asoka on their bed futon and obediently shoving a raspberry into their mouth, the others on sitting cushions. 

Eireena: **"Asoka, I want to tell you why the Peacekeepers visited us last night. Is this something you think you can hear right now?"**

Asoka looks at Eireena, suddenly scared. The raspberries in Asoka's hand have been crushed by their sudden tension.

Eireena: **"If you hear what I have to say, and all you want is to hide some place safe for the rest of your life, I guarantee that you will have that place with us. Do you understand?"**

Asoka nods: **"Yes"**

### Page 12

Eireena: **"Good. Last night, Lieutenant Colonel Santiago Garcia of the **WORLD GOV** Peacekeepers told the Green Haven Clarksville Council that he has received multiple reports of the Green Havens being attacked by large wolf-like creatures."**

A panel of flashback: the salivating fangs, the terribly cold eyes, a sense of impossibly fast movement for something so large. 

Eireena: **"The Colonel claims that although they can track these creatures, the creatures move too quickly for the Peacekeepers to hunt them down. Nonetheless, he offered to station a platoon of 40 Peacekeepers at our Green Haven as protection, in case the creatures try to attack us."**

Eireena lets her cynicism creep onto her face. 

Eireena: **"I can't say that we can trust their motives at all, but we have little choice...your story confirms the terrifying results of having no protection against these '**DEATH DOGS**'. So we will have Peacekeepers at our Green Haven, and soon, I fear that no Green Haven will be without **WORLD GOV** military presence. I don't think I need to say how much this will compromise our dedication to anonymity and a life free from surveillance."**

Eireena now looks hard at Asoka. 

Eireena: **"If you take your sanctuary with us, this is the life we forsee having to accept. However...if you feel able to travel a more dangerous and risky, but potentially more rewarding path...there is another option."**

## Chapter 4: The Sky is the Daily Bread of the Eyes 

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Eireena McLeland, Serena Ramirez, Fili Jackson

### Page 1

Iri: *"Soka, the landing team is coming back!"*

We see a [dock landing ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dock_landing_ship) of the **WORLD GOV** Peacekeepers, the planetside branch of the **WORLD GOV** military. The ship is near the lush, marshy coastline of Florida, haloed in a hazy, late morning sun. We see a faint outline of Iri camouflaged against the stern of the ship, just above the entrance to the well deck, watching incoming amphibious vehicles bustling with Peacekeepers in full environmental hazard suits. 

*THE SHIP NEEDS A NAME!*

Cut to -- We see the shimmering outline of a fully camouflaged Asoka is in the ship's galley, stuffing armloads of food into a sack, also shimmering with Biononymous camouflage technology. 

We see a view of Asoka's wide eyes, on a face somewhat thinner than before, from behind their face veil. The inside of the face veil shows the view that Iri sees, hanging onto the outside of the ship.

Iri: *"Soka, they've reached the ship!!"*

Asoka runs to a corner of the galley, where they kick open a panel in the wall, then squeeze themselves inside, cradeling the food nearly bursting from the invisible sack. They put down the sack and replace the panel in the wall. 

From inside, Asoka hurriedly pulls out what looks like fabric tape and carefully but quickly tapes the metal panel in place. After a moment, the fabric tape integrates itself into the surrounding metal, and the panel seemingly disappears. 

Asoka: *"I'm in!"*

Iri: *"Good. I'm gonna go check the bridge for any news."*

### Page 2

Asoka lies on their back in the interstitial space of the ship, surrounded by the canned food, packets of freeze-dried fruits and vegetables, and institutional white flour bread rolls that have spilled out of the still invisible pack. Asoka has turned off their camouflage, and we see that their clothes are now embroidered with eSyrup thread, which glimmer in elaborate, rune-like patterns. Asoka now also wears a utility belt, and out of one pocket we see the trailing ends of the fabric tape that sealed and hid Asoka's entry panel. They've pulled aside their face veil in order to stuff one of the bread rolls into their mouth. Their eyes are full of tears, triggered by gratitude for the food, by homesickness, by anxiety, by wanting to be free of the metal walls around them. 

Asoka: *"Jeshua's bread was so much better..."*

Iri: *"Don't cry while you eat, you'll choke on your snot!"*

Asoka drags their sleeve across their eyes to clear the tears, then sits up to eat in earnest. Asoka tears open a package of dried fruits and nuts and shovels the food into their mouth. 

Iri: *"Slow down! Do you wanna choke on your food instead?"*

Asoka: *"I gotta eat it before I realise how fake it tastes, otherwise I'll lose my appetite."*

Iri moves invisibly across the flight deck of the dock landing ship.

Iri: *"Ugh, your guts are going through so much abuse right now..."*

### Page 3

We see Iri clinging invisibly to the ceiling of the command deck. Below Iri, Peacekeepers stand at workstations that look like mega-industrial versions of the **INFO-SPHERE** desk we saw Iúna using back in 2066. 

*Need to consult with someone who knows how a naval vessel works and what kinds of daily activities would happen on board.*

Peacekeeper 1: **"This heat is brutal...you can tell we're only 6 degrees north of the Red Zone..."**

*The Red Zone extends throughout the region between the [Tropic of Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer) and the [Tropic of Capricorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Capricorn).*

Peacekeeper 2: **"I'd rather be out here than back in those marsh caves! Eeugh, the smell!!"**

Peacekeeper 3: **"I feel a little bad about re-supplying off them...they don't seem to have much space to grow food..."**

Peacekeeper 2: **"Well, we either take their food or we starve as soon as we pass the Bahamas!"**

Peacekeeper 1: **"(snort) You'd think the quartermaster would have rationed our food more accurately..."**

Iri: *"I hope you grabbed enough food to last the rest of the journey...they might be keeping a closer eye on the galley from here on out..."*

### Page 4

Asoka, kneeling, stares glumly yet resignedly at the pile of food in front of them. 

Asoka: *"This isn't what I expected..."*

*--flashback--*

**"12 days ago..."**

We are back at Green Haven Clarksville, the morning after Asoka arrived and begged for sanctuary. 

Eireena: **"Serena overheard some of the Peacekeeper's talking -- apparently, stationing troops at the Green Havens wasn't Lieutenant Colonel Garcia's original mission. He's actually on his way to the Red Zone, to a location in the former Amazon Rainforest, where the **WORLD GOV**'s satellites have captured images of what looks like *humans*."** 

Serena: **"They're, apparently, *re-growing* the forest. And instead of showing the appropriate *awe* for *anyone* who could do that, the Peacekeepers were going on about how much 'exotic fruit' they were going to be able to bring back home. *Idiots*. Don't they realise what killed the forest in the first place?"**

### Page 5

Serena: **"They said the humans were *naked*. If an entire amphibious warship, full of pirate-minded soldiers, wasn't on its way to exploit the shit out of these people, I would say it's a hilarious joke. *Naked*, in the Red Zone?? Most of our best textiles can't keep you alive in the Red Zone for much longer than a day, there's so much heat and poison in the air...it's *crazy*..."**

Serena: **"But if it's true...imagine what powerful allies they could be...!"**

Eireena coughs discreetly and gives Serena a sharp look, then turns to Asoka.

Eireena: **"This morning, we convened an emergency High Council, linking together every Biononymous Green Haven in the Northern Hemisphere. There are...*conflicting*...opinions, as to whether we should try to make contact with these people before the **WORLD GOV** does. In the end, we decided to leave the choice up to *you*."**

Asoka and Iri realise that everyone is looking at them. They exchange a glance. 

Asoka: **"Me? Why would you do that?"**

Serena: **"You're the only one allowed to wear it."**

Asoka: **"Wear what?"**

Eireena: **"Eat the raspberries in your hand, and come with me please. Bring the oatcakes and juice."**

### Page 6

Eireena leads the way, flanked by Serena and Asoka. Iri, feeling bolder, is now balanced on top of Asoka's head, who dutifully eats oatcakes and drinks juice. Fili walks behind them. Asoka and Iri take comfort in the embroidered tapestry lining the hallways, depicting familiar passages and stories from Biononymous scripture.

Eireena: **"I used to be a materials engineer, before The Burning. I was working as part of an international project to create affordable, easy-to-use eSyrup water and air filters, working with an incredible woman, who owned a textile manufacturing company. We perfected the process of doping natural fibers with eSyrup, so that we could make the finest, softest of organzas, that had exceptional filtration properties and very simple voltage-treatment protocols. It was a beautiful time for science."**

Eireena: **"So we wove miles and miles of this eSyrup thread into filters that we gave away for free, to anyone who needed it! It was grand. And we didn't like the government, so we moved to Vermont. And spent many late nights, talking to like-minded friends about how body mods were just embedding all these trackable, *hackable* devices right into our bodies, with no option to get off the radar! It was gonna ruin society, we were all very convinced."**

Eireena: **"But there *are* some undeniable advantages to having powerful technology right at your fingertips. And we were discovering that our organzas were capable of so much more than just filtering the water and the air. So we decided that we needed to keep the option for living without body mods on the table, by researching *alternatives* to body mods, and the only way to do *that* was to create a religion, because in those days, religions had the best defense against government interference."**

### Page 7

Eireena: **"But then The Burning happened, and everyone we feared much abandoned us anyway, on a planet that *they'd* trashed."**

Serena: **"Until they came back to demand food, fuel, and whatever the hell they wanted...not much has changed."**

Eireena pulls back a tapestry, which, to a naive eye looks no different from any of the other wall tapestries in terms of its function. But behind this tapestry is another small room. Inside is a tall wooden dresser. Eireena holds the tapestry open and gestures everyone inside before her. 

Eireena: **"Please."**

Fili opens the tall wooden dresser. Inside is an exquisite outfit of the Biononymous, embroidered in elaborate tiny patterns and dressed on a flat mannequin. Neatly folded in the bottom of the dresser is a utility belt on top of a large cloth satchel. Asoka looks closer and gasps -- the tiny patterns are in the style of their home Haven! Asoka reaches with their hand, then hesitates. 

Asoka: **"May I?"**

Fili: **"It's yours."**

### Page 8

Asoka lifts the jacket off the mannequin, reverently running their hands over the stitches, the weave, the hem. As Asoka does this, the cloth responds to their touch. 

Asoka: **"This is *beautiful*. Where did it come from?"**

Fili: **"Many years ago, two members of your Green Haven council visited us, with this magnificent wooden dresser, and a beautiful child's outfit made of the finest eSyrup cloth we had ever seen. Your Councilors showed us the faces of the Green Haven Howes children, then asked us to safeguard this outfit, and never show it to anyone, unless a child from their Haven should ever have to beg us for sanctuary."**

Eireena: **"It's called 'cuttlefish cloth', a new kind of eSyrup textile that can be 'voltage-treated' by the electrical activity of your nervous system. It can extend your homeostatic range -- help you survive both colder and hotter environments, filter and purify insanely dirty water or air, and withstand an enormous amount of radiation. With practice, it can even camouflage its wearer *completely*, making you, more or less, *invisible*."**

Serena's eyes twinkle. 

Serena: **"And it's powered by your waste products."**

Asoka: **"Wait, what??"**

### Page 9

Serena's eyes never waver, face inscrutable. 

Serena: **"Everything that passes through your gut is processed by your enteric nervous system, a network of *500 million* neurons - that's *5 times* as many as the neurons in your *spine*. You'd do well to respect what you eat, cuz now that's also powering your protective bubble against the world."**

Serena grins now. 

Serena: **"Besides, the first outfit was for a little one just barely able to walk -- it needed to be a diaper too! It's basically a body-diaper! It uses your waste and gives you protection, a poop-powered safety bubble..."**

Asoka looks horrified. Eireena hides her smile. 

Eireena: **"Anyways, every year since then, different members of your Council have visited us, each time showing us the faces of a child, or grandchild, and bringing a new outfit, a little bit larger each time, and taking back the old one."**

Eireena: **"And last year, I got a visit from my old friend, who told me about her grandchild, and showed me *your* face. Iúna told me that, even though she was supposed to be making this outfit for *any* child of Green Haven Howes, she was thinking *most* of *you*."**

Asoka: **"So you knew my avó Iúna!"**

Eireena smiles broadly. 

Eireena: **"Yes."**

### Page 10

Asoka stares down at the cuttlefish cloth. 

Asoka: **"Are the...**DEATH DOGS**...and the Peacekeepers...part of why avó was bringing you this outfit in secret?"**

Asoka looks pained. 

Asoka: **"And...if it was supposed to save the children of Green Haven Howes...how come there's only *one*??"**

Eireena drops the smile, and Serena's face darkens. Fili has tears in his eyes, jaw clenched.

Eireena: **"This research would be incredibly dangerous in the hands of someone willing to exploit others...if the **WORLD GOV** found out about it, they wouldn't be using their military just to *intimidate* us into giving them more *food*."**

Asoka suddenly remembers -- the snarls, the screams, the smell of freshly baked bread...

Asoka looks up to see everyone patiently waiting for them to recover from the flashback. 

Eireena places a hand on Asoka's shoulder, gentle but grim. 

Eireena: **"Like I said before, if you want to live a quiet life in hiding, you can have that here at Green Haven Clarksville."**

### Page 11

Eireena: **"But with an outfit made of cuttlefish cloth, you're protected from both the **WORLD GOV** *and* any surface environment on this planet, even the Red Zone. The one who wears this outfit will be the most anonymous, the most free, and the only one who has *any* chance of delivering an offer of alliance to these people in the Amazon."**

Eireena: **"If you accept this outfit, the High Council beg you to also accept this diplomatic mission: to warn the people in the Amazon of the Peacekeeper's intentions, and offer them alliance with the Biononymous. In return, we will provide you with everything you need to travel to the Amazon, and the Biononymous will trust you with our collective voice."**

*--end flashback--*

We're back in the double-layered hull of the amphibious warship. Asoka kneels, staring down at the food spilling out of their invisible satchel, lost in thought. 

Iri: *"Soka?"*

Asoka: *"Hmm?"*

Iri: *"I'm on the bridge, they're discussing the location! Put up your face veil!"*

### Page 12

Asoka pulls the fabric back across their face, and sees the world through Iri's eyes. Up on the command deck, a large **INFO-SPHERE** displays a map of the Americas, a glowing blue line tracing a the ship's path down the eastern coast of North America. At the latitude of Gainesville, Florida, the line becomes a tiny glowing dock landing ship made of light. A blue dotted line extends south from the tiny glowing ship of light, swerving east to avoid the flooded remains of the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the western most curve of the Caribbean Islands, to then hug the coasts of Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and finally, the Amapá state of Brazil, bordered to the southeast by a great river delta -- there the dotted line curves intimately inland, wiggling up the Amazon River until it terminates in a second, more ghostly little ship made of light, nearly halfway across the continent to the Pacific coast. This little ship of light sprouts a dark brown line that shoots almost exactly north for a seemingly tiny distance, then terminates in a blinking, glowing 'X'. 

Asoka: **"So. That's where we're going."**

**"The Red Zone was once called 'the tropics', a band of the Earth's surface bounded in the north by the Tropic of Cancer, and at its southern edge by a similarly outdated name, the Tropic of Capricorn. Even in the heart of winter, 'the tropics' had over 10 hours of daylight, something that, at one time, made it irresistable to conquerers, colonists, imperialists, and ex-pats alike."**

**"They came for the clear blue waters full of iridescent fish and fascinatingly complex coral reefs; extravagant, multi-coloured birds-of-paradise and thrillingly powerful felines in enormous, lush forests; and rich soils teeming with plants that move and insects that wage war. But these jewels of biodiversity were far more delicate and fragile than they looked. By the time the Global Water Crisis hit, much of what made 'the tropics' so lovely and desirable was gone."**

Under this narration, we see Asoka and Iri looking back over a rocky outcrop to the north of the flooded, abandoned ruins of Manaus, full moon big in the night sky, as they head into the forest, quick and nimble, carrying only Asoka's cuttlefish-skin satchel. Below, the Peacekeepers unload vehicles, supplies, and equipment from the dock landing ship and set up a large, noisy, destructive camp on another outcropping along the north edge of the ruins.

**"Nowadays, temperatures in the Red Zone become fatally hot during the day, and any living thing without protection during those hours withers away into dust."**

Asoka: **"Ok Iri, how many hours until sunrise?"**

Iri: **"Probably only 4...it took us too long to get off the ship!"**

Asoka: **"It's alright, we'll manage! So we run for 3 hours and then start looking for a cave, a thicket, anything to hide from the sun."**

Iri: **"Just remember, you've been crawling in between the walls of a double-hulled warship for the last 28 days -- that's almost a month!"**

Asoka is running, breathless. 

Asoka: **"Yeah, so?"**

Iri: **"I just hadn't realised how long you were in there..."**

As Asoka runs, their face veil shows them overlays of annotations about the environment around them. What happens to the Amazon in 100 years, after massive deforestation, brutal heat, CO2 and NO2 heavy atmosphere, and NO2 acid rain decimate most of the life, and then someone comes along and is starting to re-grow the forest?

### Page 3

It's the earliest part of dawn - [astronomical dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn#Astronomical_dawn). Asoka leans against a rock to catch their breath. 

Asoka: *"How...far...??"*

Iri brings up the map they image-captured from the bridge of **WARSHIP**. 

Iri: **"Ummmmm...there!"**

A bright blue ball appears, far less than halfway to the blinking 'X'. Asoka gasps and shakes sweat into the cloth of their head scarf and face veil. The fabric is damp, but then quickly dries, as if the cloth were drinking up the fluid. 

Asoka: *"Seriously?? That's it??"*

Iri: *"Sokaaa, don't push yourself too much..."*

Asoka takes off their pack and pulls out a canteen of water. They guzzle the water through their face veil. 

Asoka: *"My guts don't feel completely empty yet..."*

Asoka: **"Iri, when do you predict the temperature will hit 37.5?"**

Iri: **"In about...3 hours? But..."**

Zoom in on Asoka's eyes, fiercely determined. 

Asoka: **"We have to get there *first*, Iri!"**

### Page 4

**"Human body cells start to die in temperatures above 41 deg celsius, but in dry air, humans can survive much higher temperatures, such as 70 deg C, as long as we can stay hydrated. In humid, tropical air, however, anything above 47 deg is cause for concern, and getting respite from the heat is crucial."**




Iri: **"Yes, good! Ok, so, ummmmm, go left! There's a really low temperature area over there, maybe it's a cave!"**






Asoka rushed ahead of the Peacekeepers to the location that the **WORLD GOV** designated as the best spot to search for the mysterious Amazonian people, arriving much faster than the loud, noisy, bulky, slow-moving military troops. From that location, Asoka has been searching in an ever growing spiral, with no success. Just as Asoka is about to pass out from hunger and heatstroke, Iri discovers a cave with a false wall, behind which is a garden, clearly cultivated by *someone*. Asoka and Iri find an opening into the secret garden, which provides Asoka with food, water, and respite from the heat. Asoka is so grateful to be alive that they are completely caught unawares by Min, who doesn't recognise the Biononymous clothing and thinks that a ghost or evil spirit is raiding her garden. Min engages the stranger in combat, and knocks off Asoka's head veil. After realising that the evil spirit is actually a human, Min listens to Asoka as Asoka tells Min about the World Gov Peacekeepers. After Asoka has recovered enough to venture back out into the heat, Asoka shows Min the Peacekeepers as they noisily set up base camp and plow through the forest with no regard for the flora and fauna they are destroying. Furious, Min agrees to present Asoka to the Elders of her clan, the Automata. 

## Dream 2: Rites of Passage

### Page 1

Bonfires on a warm night. Shadows of well-choreographed ritual dancers, powerful and strong from a lifetime of training, hover warmly, protectively. The view is zoomed out so that we see Min from above. Min is topless, sitting inside a large, fat metal hoop, a la Cyr Wheel. She is surrounded in many concentric circles of family and friends, all dressed in their most splendid clothing made of cloth infused with one of the AUTOMATA's original, surviving eSyrup cultures, called "Mothers". Everyone in the concentric circles are holding hands and focused on Min, their bodies convulsing in synchronised group ritual dance. 

Drum beats keep everyone synchronised.

**"Another Tree Surfer is born tonight."**

Over this backdrop, small close-up panels are scattered, showing different parts of 16 year old Min, large swaths of skin covered in proudly displayed, ecstatically dancing clan tatoos:   
* an eye, nose, and ear. The eye is determined, steely, and dilated with adrenaline and euphoria. The nose and ear are pierced with eSyrup metal, formed into plain, elegantly raw shapes with rounded edges. The brow is set and only slightly sweaty. The head is shaved and covered in tatoos of her achievements as a clan member and Arborist. 
* a strong and straight back, dominated by an eSyrup tatoo depicting a shallow coral ocean scene, ever-changing.  
* shoulder and neck from the front, collar bone straight in a relaxed line that is perfectly parallel to the bottom edge of the panel. Neck is a bit clenched, and tendrils of Min's back tatoo curl around from her back in comforting, fractal patterns.  
* legs, covered in line art encoding her family lineage, are folded in an easy lotus, covered in the soft folds of ritual clothing appropriate for the ascent of a Journeyhume Arborist to the status of Expert Crafter: Tree Surfer. 

**"To be reborn, each Expert Crafter of the Automata must first retreat to one of the sacred caves and refrain from both speech and food for 7 days. Then, they must accept an injection of *raw eSyrup*."**

**"The raw eSyrup is engineered to look for radioactive proteins that mark the cells that were part of the [ectoderm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm), the outer layer of the human embryo. Every Automata, being born in the Red Zone, has lifelong tags on the cells of their skin, hair, nails, eyes, teeth, sinuses, and nervous system."**

### Page 2

3 panels show close-up views of the people in the inner most circle, just on the outside of the metal hoop:  

* Jina, also covered in clan tatoos and splendid eSyrup ritual clothing. Jina's subdermal shield is visible in shadowy patterns under her clan tatoos. Next to her is a tall bucket holding ritual clensing water.  
* Amadou, no subdermal shield and just a few clan tatoos, but dressed spledidly and unspeakably proud of his daughter.   
* Majhee, matriarch leader of their clan, subdermal shield barely visible beneath the many clan tatoos. She is proud, stern, and exhuberant on this day of achievement by her granddaughter.  
* Maraba, Min's cousin and dearest childhood companion, now an Expert Inker and chosen for the honour of injecting Min's subdermal shield. Next to Maraba, in a shallow curving woven basket, is an enormous syringe full of swirling, bubbling, raw eSyrup, freshly harvested from one of their original, surviving cultures, called "Mothers". 

**"DOOOOHM!"** 

The drums all come to a halt, and all of the concentric circles except the innermost lean in sharply on that last booming beat, hands all stretched towards Min, fingers shaking. 

Jina, Majhee, Amadou, and Maraba stand up and pick up the metal hoop. They hold it in place as Min steps onto the curving metal, hands pushing against the hoop above her head. Then they strap Min's ankles and wrists to the metal hoop. 

### Page 3

Maraba picks up the syringe as Jina picks up the bucket of water, leaving Majhee and Amadou to hold the hoop with Min inside steady. 

Jina pours the bucket of water slowly over Min until Min is drenched, then returns the bucket to its previous location in the circle. Then Maraba positions the needle of the syringe full of raw eSyrup against Min's right buttcheek, breaks the skin, and slowly injects all of the eSyrup as Min grits her teeth. 

Min's cousin pulls out the syringe and places it back on the basket. Then Jina, Amadou, Majhee, and Maraba turn Min in slow circles as the raw eSyrup spreads throughout her body, spreading up her torso, across her arms and legs, over her face, and into her eyelids. As the subdermal shield continues into her mouth, nose, and sinuses, Min begins to cough and gag. 

### Page 4

Min's body convulses as her inner circle sets her upright in the very center again. 

The crowd chants **"Be Free! Be FREE! BE FREE!"** as Min finishes integrating the subdermal shield. 

After a tense moment, Min focuses her subdermal awareness to sprout razor sharp spikes at her wrists and ankles, cutting her bonds. The crowd roars with triumph. 

## Chapter 6

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Majhee Suh, Nicola Cavalcanti, Nova Jatobá, Jina Suh Barbosa, Amadou Touré 

Asoka tells the Elders of the Automata everything that the Biononymous know about the **WORLD GOV** and present the Biononymous' offer for alliance. The Elders debate the offer, and in the end decide to reject the alliance and move deeper into the Amazon, in the hopes that the Automata can avoid confrontation with the **WORLD GOV** indefinitely. The Elders offer to help Asoka return to the other side of the Red Zone, so that they can relay the Automata's response in person and return home. Asoka confesses that they are able to remotely broadcast the response to the other Biononymous, and besides, they had no more home to go back to. The Elders then offer Asoka asylum with the Automata and invite Asoka to come with them, in exchange for answering the questions of the Elders about the Biononymous and their technology. Fearful of the potential of betraying their dead parents, Asoka hesitates. Having few other options, Asoka accepts asylum with the Automata but asks for time to process before talking about their dead parents' and their research. Asoka uses Iri to relay the news back to Eireena - that the Automata have chosen to decline the offer of alliance, and have decided to go deeper into hiding. Eireena tells Asoka that more Peacekeepers have been stationed at every Green Haven, and that the **WORLD GOV** is now demanding 50% of the Green Havens' yearly yield, supposedly to feed the Peacekeepers who are keeping the Green Havens safe from the **DEATH DOGS**. Eireena shares her belief that the **DEATH DOGS** are creations of the **WORLD GOV**, meant to create an atmosphere of terror so that the **WORLD GOV** can subdue the planetside population into fearful obedience. Upon hearing this news, Asoka falls into a deep, dark depression. 

## Chapter 7: How we evolve

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Minka Oosou, Jina Suh Barbosa, Amadou Touré

Min goes to see Asoka and tries to stir Asoka out of their depression by telling Asoka that moping only dishonours the deaths of their Green Haven. Asoka lashes out - how could Min possibly understand how they feel? Min responds by telling Asoka the story of her parents, and how her father Amadou, who was born in an Underground City ruled by a terrible tyrant, lost his parents and nearly everyone he knew and loved in the effort to overthrow the tyrant. Amadou once dreamed of becoming a space explorer, but is now a wanted criminal with a bounty on his head because he killed the tyrant ruler of his home city, so there is no way he can leave the safety of asylum with the Automata. Min tells Asoka of her dream to become a space explorer in her father's stead, by applying to the International Space Exploration Corps via the Space Asylum Program, and encourages Asoka to do the same, reasoning that if Asoka wants to help the Biononymous fight the **WORLD GOV**, they don't need this alliance with the Automata - much more useful would be to go into orbit and learn more about the Orbiters, the principle actors in the **WORLD GOV**. Convinced, Asoka vows to get to the ISE Corps no matter what it takes.
