"A long time ago..."

"before the Orbiters lived in the sky,"

"before we hid underground to survive **THE BURNING OCEANS** and The Severing,"

"we all lived together, on the Earth's surface."

"We could all breathe the air,"

"drink the water,"

"feel the sun."

"We were all... 

"FREE."

## Chapter 1: Calm Before the Storm

### Page 1

**"2076: São Paulo, Brazil"**

**"It was a day of hope and wonder."** 

**"The Space Consortium had just announced the completion of their third space farm, **THE UPPER ESTATES SPACE ARBORETUM**. The news feeds were drowning in photos of the ribbon-cutting event up in orbit, of beautiful, important people draped in gorgeously fashionable and unspeakably expensive formal attire, eSyrup fabric programmed to fluidly morph in response to the lights, the music, their wearers' moods..."**

**"...of delicate, mouth-watering hors d'oeuvres made from the succulent crops grown and cultivated at the two older space farms, with their carefully filtered water and pristine soil..."**

**"...of the fleet of orbiting home pods that synchronised their velocities with the new arboretum in order to snag front row seats to this historic moment, when humanity proved its ingenuity once more..."**

**"...for the world was becoming too dirty, too extreme in its weather, to support industrial planetside farming..."**

**"...and many people, on this historic day of hope and wonder, were starving..."**

Under this narration, we see a young Majhee walking briskly through the crowded streets of São Paulo. Everyone is wearing what looks like light-weight full-body hazmat suits, flickering a bit as the eSyrup in the material absorbs dangerous radiation in the air, hoods up, breathing masks and googles on. The air is hazy with smog, the sky a smeared grey-blue, the mid-morning sun pale. As Majhee passes shops and cafes, the daily news appears in hologram-like projections that occupy the ceilings or hover at standing-head-height. Other humans have tiny projections coming from subdermally implanted chips in their wrists, palms, ears, or foreheads; these projections surround their wrists, palms, ears, or face with a sphere of light, either sonifying or visualising entertainment, memories, mental models, dreams, news, scholarly publications. 

A lot of the news is about the new space arboretum, but most of the individual info-spheres are focused on news about planetside climate disasters: 
* The Colorado River has dried up completely and the severe drought is causing mass migrations to east, causing massive overcrowding in major inland ("mid-western") cities. 
* Last year's total evaporation of the River Niger has heightened ethnic tensions in the area and armed conflict is escalating.
* An extremely aggressive water-borne disease wipes out several major urban areas in China and India 
* Illnesses from sun radiation, such as skin cancer, have a thousand-fold jump in rate of diagnosis around the world.

### Page 2

We see Majhee walk past a large research facility, metal and glass architecture dully gleaming in the smoggy light, labeled "Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública". The front of the research facility is teeming with protesters, who hold signs and wave flags with slogans like "Não sirva aos tiranos em órbita!", "Educar crianças humanas, não máquinas corporativas!", and "Alimentar humanos não foguetes!"

Majhee sneaks into an alleyway to enter the research facility via a back door. We see a receptionist sitting behind a sealed glass window. Next to him is a decontamination chamber that all must pass thru in order to enter the research facility. 

Receptionist: **"Dr. Suh! How bad is it out there?"**

Majhee takes off her hood and googles and we see her face - pretty and youthful for her 41 years, if it weren't for the lines of worry and grim determination. She shakes out her hair, cropped short in a bowl pixie cut. Clearly burdened with many troubles, she begins taking off her eSyrup hazmat suit.  

Majhee: **"Still crowded."**

Receptionist: **"Idiots. Don't they understand we're trying to help?"**

Majhee: **"Well, they're hungry. Can't think when you're hungry."**

Majhee removes her boots and steps into the decontamination chamber.

### Page 3

Majhee stands in her office, seemingly floating in the center of a giant transparent bacteria made of light. The light model of the bacteria is exquisitely detailed, and a section of the nucleoid is blown up for closer inspection. Majhee's fingers are raised in a well-practiced yet complicated gesture. Her face is darkened with barely contained rage. 

Off panel: **"Majhee, you can't *scoop* the *Space Consortium*..."**

Majhee: **"For the last time, Marcia, it's not scooping if I'm making everything freely accessible!"**

We see Marcia Netto, President of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, in Majhee's doorway, rubbing her forehead with exasperation.

Marcia: **"You know what I mean. They are *determined* to make money off eSyrup applications, and when you post your lab's developments online under a Creative Commons license, you make that application of eSyrup tech *unpatentable*."**

Majhee: **"Exactly."**

Marcia: **"But you saw what they did with after our collaboration to develop eSyrup fuel! This institute cannot afford another round of legal action like that!"**

### Page 4

Majhee angrily turns off the giant bacteria of light with an impatient gesture as she turns to Marcia, furious.

Majhee: **"*You* pushed that collaboration through, against my numerous objections!"** 

Marcia, immediately apologetic, hands up to ward off Majhee's anger

Marcia: **"I know, I *know*, that was definitely my mistake, and I'm *sorry*."**

Majhee interrupts: **"And stop talking like you actually *believe* in propriatary health research! How is it possible that *anyone* can still hold such *archaic* views?"**

Marcia, defeated: **"*sigh*. Just...be careful."** 

Marcia looks over her shoulder, then turns back to Majhee.

Marcia, low and careful: **"There are rumors that the Space Consortium is trying to *weaponize* eSyrup. I know I sound like a conspiracy theorist, but..."**

Majhee, incredulous: **"They wouldn't dare--"**

Felix, a scientist in Majhee's lab, appears at the doorway, breathless and distraught.

Felix: **"Majhee, my father-- President Netto!"**

Majhee: **"I'm sorry Marcia, we'll have to continue this another time."**

### Page 5

Majhee, Felix, and other members of Majhee's research group sit in a meeting room in an upper floor of the research institute. One wall is a floor-to-ceiling window, showing the dusty sky-line of São Paulo. The sun sits in a reddish hazy sky, just past the midday zenith. 

Majhee: **"So. Your father has been diagnosed again."**

The circle of researchers: **Felix Grael**, a pale but handsome man in his late 20s, raised in Rio de Janeiro by Swedish immigrants who have since returned to Europe, his face lined with fear and sadness, head in hands as his elbows rest on his knees; **Kai Oliveira**, a much older woman of Japanese-Portuguese descent, grey-haired and hook-nosed, stern-faced and sitting stiffly in her chair; **Beatriz Cavalcanti**, a tall woman in her 30s, a Brazilian of Italian descent, mouth set in a grim line even as her hands squeeze Felix's shoulders in a motherly, comforting gesture; **Breno Leite**, a dark, thin man in his early 30s, born and raised in the streets of São Paulo by his young Brazilian single mother, who worked every day of her short life in order to send her son to university; **Nova Jatobá**, a young graduate student in her mid-20s, descended from indiginous Brazilians from deeper inland, her plump face lined with exhaustion; **Iara Gracie**, another young grad student in her mid-20s, who was born into an old Brazilian martial arts family but chose the life of a scientist instead; **Vec Barbosa**, a portly Brazilian man of West African descent in his 40s, hands resignedly folded over a substantial beer belly, face troubled and sad behind a rather bushy yet neatly-trimmed beard.

Vec, to Felix: **"Beatriz and I have already contacted your father's medical team in Romania, and we've given them access to our database on repeat skin cancer patients. This will greatly improve his chances of recovery, but..."**

Beatriz, kindly: **"We also remember that your father had a liver transplant last year. If you want to go home to be with your family, everyone will understand."**

Felix now looks up, straight at Majhee, eyes full of furious determination.

Felix: **"But...we need to finish the biofilm project! *Before* Space Consortium can get their filthy hands on another patent!"**

Felix covers his face with his hands, furious at the tears that have started to stream down his face.

Beatriz: **"I'm sure we could manage--"**

Kai, arms folded, looking down at her lap with hard eyes.

Kai: **"We can't finish this project in time without Felix. We all know splicing's more art than algorithm, and ever since my hands starting hurting too much, Felix is our *best*."**

Kai: **"But even our best may not be enough...this morning Space Consortium patented photovoltaic cells made of eSyrup-spliced halobacterium, and I got *this*."** 

Kai passes up a small card to Majhee. Majhee reads from it.

Majhee: **"'You've been slapped on the wrists. Don't make us go for your throat.'"**

Nova, looking terrified: **"What's that supposed to mean??"**

Kai: **"Space Consortium's telling us to stop competing with them. Suing us for exclusive patents on eSyrup fuel was the slap on the wrists."**

### Page 6

Iara: **"My grandfather also called this morning...he told me he was offered 10 billian reais last week to convince me to report our unpublished work."**

Felix: **"What??"**

Iara: **"Apparently that wasn't the first time either...he got a similar offer last year as well, but he thought it wasn't worth mentioning because he knew I wouldn't go for it."**

Nova, aghast: **"10 billion reais...that's more than the institute's endowment..."** 

Vec: **"It's worth it. A stable splice with a bacterial colony is the first step towards splicing eSyrup with human cells, and if Space Consortium can manage to patent living splices, they'll have a monopoly on all future clinical and medical applications of eSyrup."**

We see Breno's moody, cynical eyes. 

Breno: **"I'm sure 10 billion is nothing to a trust-fund baby like Iara..."**

Felix: **"Breno, how dare you! You know none of us would sell-out to Space Consortium, no matter the price!"**

Breno, smiles ruefully, eyes pitying: **"Really? That kind of money would give my mother the same quality of treatment that your father gets for free in Sweden. What makes you think I wouldn't give in to a temptation like that?"**

Felix: **"Well then good thing Majhee is paying those doctors' bribes, yeah?! If Iara is privileged, then so are you!"**

We see the circle of researchers sitting in silence, betraying varying degrees of discomfort and fear.

### Page 7 

Majhee: **"I can't...*ask* anyone to stay. We all know the risks that come with working on this project, with working in this city right now. We all have family to protect."**

Majhee: **"But...*personally*...I can't give up now. If we don't get these eSyrup protocols into the public domain, many will suffer because they can't pay Space Consortium's price."**

Majhee: **"If you feel you must leave, I will do what I can to help you and your family get out of this city, and off Space Consortium's radar."**

Majhee: **"If you stay...I will forever owe you a debt of gratitude...and I swear, I will protect you and your families in any way that I can."**

**"6 months later: Massachusetts, USA"**

We see rolling countryside, vibrant with autumn colors, behind a low row of concrete warehouses, labeled "Morei Textiles". 

Off-panel, secretary: **"Iúna, the folks from the World Health Organization are here."**

Off-panel, Iúna: **"Thanks, I'll be with them in a moment."**

We see the inside of a warehouse, where long rows of industrial looms weave eSyrup textiles. Their combined activity generates a gently deafening **"WHIRRRRR"**. Iúna Morei, a tall shapely American woman of Portuguese descent in her early 30s, lustrous wavy brown hair pulled up into a bun, an infant with thick black hair strapped to her front, walks briskly and confidently away from a door labeled "Quiet Room" towards a group of humans waiting near the main entrance of the warehouse. 

Iúna smiles and yells as she waves towards her office door, just next to the entrance to the warehouse and labeled "Iúna Morei, CEO of Morei Textiles".

Iúna: **"HELLO! SHALL WE STEP INTO MY OFFICE?"**

### Page 8

Iúna: **"Thank you for bringing the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols from São Paulo."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"You know, you'd get these updates a lot faster if you'd just get an info-sphere mod..."**

Iúna: **"Dr. Kauffmann, I'm sure your colleagues can tell you how adamantly opposed I am to body modifications and eSyrup implants. I'm extremely grateful that you've taken the time to travel all the way from DC today."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Well, we were in Boston for an emergency conference, so it wasn't too much trouble. Besides, no one can beat your MERV filter efficiency ratings, not with sheer fabrics at least. I've got your organzas in every window of my house."**

Iúna: **"Just doing what we can. What was the emergency conference about?"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"They're preparing themselves for a huge wave of refugees."**

Iúna: **"Really? From where?"**

Under this dialogue is a view of Iúna's desk. We see sneak peek's of the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols visualized with light, a floating sphere controlled by a thick piece of eSyrup canvas, stretched on a semi-circular frame that, when Iúna stands inside of it, places the canvas at about hip height, easy to reach while standing. Either one large image or many very close-up views. 

### Page 9

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Didn't you hear? A police raid in L.A. this morning started a huge fire that's spread halfway up the coast of California. It's so big it's getting blown over the mountains into Arizona by high winds. Everything out there is bone dry ever since the Colorado River disappeared."**

Iúna: **"What?? How many dead??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Unfortunately we haven't had a chance to count yet. Thousands are already homeless."**

Iúna: **"How does a police raid start a state-wide fire??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"It's all the plastic furniture - they're basically *solid* petroleum, turns a misplaced candle into a fireball in just *minutes*. And LA to San Francisco is so packed with cheap cookie-cutter homes, in retrospect, I'm amazed this didn't happen sooner. I'm sorry, I should have realised you wouldn't have heard yet...do you know anyone over there?"**

Iúna: **"Yes, I...I'm sorry I need to make a call..."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Of course. I'll see myself out."**

Under this dialogue we see close-up views of the baby strapped to Iúna's front. The child is a little less than one year old. The strapping is an intricately folded piece of eSyrup cloth that can amplify the baby's heartrate, breathing, and digestive sounds. 

### Page 10

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, have you been able to contact Joshua Tree?*"**

Iúna is outside, and her baby is no longer strapped to her chest. Instead, her face is covered in a thick veil and she wears what looks like a heavy, full-sleeved and full-length apron. eSyrup circuits flash within the weave of both Iúna's veil and apron. She stands, facing west, arms flung out wide, back straight and tall, legs apart, boots planted wide in the frosty grass. 

Iúna's Biononymous contact at Green Haven Tahoe: **"*Negative, Mama Bird.*"**

Iúna: **"*How is Tahoe?*"**

Tahoe: **"*Fire hasn't gotten further than Fresno, but we're getting ready to offer sanctuary.*"**

Iúna: **"*So...it *was* the body mod.*"**

Tahoe: **"*Looks like it. They didn't even bother going for the decoy.*"**

### Page 11

Iúna ponders for a moment, her face furrowed with grief and concentration.

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, I've changed my mind. I vote for registering as a religion.*"**

Tahoe: **"*Wa-wait, seriously?*"**

Iúna: **"*Yes. We need all of the protections we can get right now.*"**

Tahoe: **"*You've been thinking about what Pigsah said at our last TeleSensing?*"**

Iúna: **"*Yes. They were right - it's relatively easy right now to live without body mods. But once all the schools require every student to get an info-sphere mod, once every industry requires employees to use body mods in order to be qualified for the job...our children **won't** have a choice. They'll have to list their body mods on their CV, you just won't be a qualified human *adult* if you don't have a body mod.*"**

Tahoe: **"*But...declaring ourselves a religion...it just feels like we're setting ourselves up for all the pitfalls of a *cult*.*"**

Iúna: **"*I know, and that's why I intially voted against it. But if we want defend our right to live without constant surveillance, we can't just empower individual decisions without thinking about how to co-exist with the rest of society. If we don't take drastic measures, in just 10 years our social structures will make it *impossible* to live without constant surveillance.*"**

### Page 12

Tahoe: **"*But we still haven't figured out our own solutions to the really *practical* advantages of body mods...long-distance communication, ways to aid our memories and gain perspective on our behaviour...*"**

Iúna: **"*That's why I've changed my mind. Our eSyrup research needs to expand, and it needs to stay under the radar. Tahoe, you know what that research group in Brazil published last month?*"**

Tahoe: **"*What?*"**

Iúna: **"*The first successful splice of eSyrup with a living organic compound, a recipe for creating eSyrup *biofilm*!*"**

Tahoe: **"*...Sorry Mama Bird, I don't follow eSyrup research like you do. Why should I care about biofilm?*"**

Iúna: **"*Because that's the *beginning*. Those bastards managed it before Space Consortium, got it published before Space Consortium could patent it. Do you remember how we once talked of synthetic companion creatures, that can act like portable, non-invasive info-spheres?*"**

Tahoe: **"*...yes...?*"**

Iúna: **"It's possible now. *If they can splice eSyrup with a microcolony of bacteria, then we can figure out how to splice eSyrup into bigger, more complex living things. And if creating and interacting with these creatures is part of our religious practice...*"**

Iúna: **"*...then we have much stronger grounds to deny oversight by Space Consortium, or any national government!*"**

## Chapter 2: Where Thunder Goes When It Dies

### Page 1

**"2077: Ushuaia, Argentina"**

We see a bustling harbour town, everything about it small and cute except for the occassional warehouse factory or modern high rise office building - these were clearly very recent additions to a place that otherwise hadn't changed very much in many hundreds of years.

**"When growing a personal supply of eSyrup, say, for research or for fun, you can feed it enough silica just by running down to the beach once a week with a soup bowl."**

**"Industrialized eSyrup production, however, needs quite a bit of silica."**

**"Sand mining was out of the question, given the Space Consortium's concern with their image - wouldn't want their brand tarnished by news of their operations destroying delicate coastal ecosystems or picturesque beachside communities."**

**"So they turned to the next biggest source of biogenic silica - deep-sea deposits in the Antarctic."**

We see close-ups of the [wildlife at Green Haven Cabo de Hornos](https://youtu.be/06LcgVQg7Yk) with tumultuous ocean and raw, mountainous landscape. Off in the distance, we see a tiny speck on the horizon - a deep-sea silica mining rig. A tiny plume of smoke, looking both innocent and foreboding, curls up from the rig. 

### Page 2

**"Ocean Acidification Monitoring Station, Roca Redonda, Galapagos Islands"**

Technician: **"Dr. Zambrano! Dr. Zambrano!"**

Dr. Zambrano: **"What is it?"**

Tech: **"The pH levels...do you see...!"**

Dr.Zambrano: **"Dios mío...how can it fall so fast??"**

### Page 3

**"Thermohaline Circulation Observation Centre, Orkney Islands"**

These last two scenes should give clues about the deep-sea silica drilling disaster, which suddenly makes the shallow parts of the ocean water column drastically more acidic, combined with a shut down of important ocean current circulations like the Meridional Overturning Circulation - see [this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rising-acidity-in-the-ocean/) and [this article](https://www.wunderground.com/resources/climate/abruptclimate.asp) for more info. 

### Page 4

**"São Paulo, Brazil"**

The crowds in front of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública are gone, and everyone on the street is now wearing industrial filter respirators and water boots - the streets are ankle-deep in ocean water. We see Majhee, fully dressed in protective gear and a breathing mask, weave her way through a crowd and rush into the front door of the research institute. 

Majhee: **"We need to finish packing up NOW."**

Meanwhile, in São Paulo, Majhee and her colleagues have just one year ago successfully spliced eSyrup with eukaryotic cell cultures for the first time, and now they are witnessing the birth of the first eSyrup-spliced mammal, a rat-like creature named Nimh. Nimh lives 11 days. Nimh dies on the day that the news of the deep-sea silica harvesting rig disaster reaches the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública. 

One month ago, when NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) levels in São Paulo were declared 20 times above the World Health Organisation's most recent recommended thresholds for outdoor air quality, Felix and his family moved back to Romania. 

Majhee and her colleagues pack up all of their raw eSyrup cultures and research and flee with their families inland. They hide with friends and family in caves deep under the Amazon Rainforest. 

Iúna flees with her son João into caves in Vermont to escape the huge clouds of NO2.

Amadou and his parents flee to the caves beneath Green Haven Santarém, in the Pará province of Brazil. 

Massive fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation from sun flares completely disrupt digital computing technology infrastructure. The vast majority of servers worldwide are wiped clean. *Check whether this would blow away ionosphere.*

Amid the chaos, nearly 60,000 planetside humans swarm onto Space Barges to flee into orbit. The Space Barges are overcrowded and the Space Consortium fears that too many people will try to come up into orbit and overload their resources, so they decide that, after one last trip, the Space Barges would remain docked at the Orbital stations and not return to planetside until planetside has stabilized. 

## Chapter 3

### Page 1

4 jagged panels. 1st POV of running, terrified, through a harsh and rocky landscape. Flash of memory: enormous fangs; cold, blood-red eyes. A farming village in ruins, fires consuming the large interconnected home structures and surrounding greenhouses. Dead bodies, mangled by the monstrous wolf-like creatures that are the size of a small elephant. 

Asoka trips, falling face down in the dirt. Their mechapet, a synthetic creature made to look like a cuttlefish and brought alive using eSyrup technology, chitters frantically from where it is wrapped around Asoka's neck, sheet-white with fear. Asoka's clothes are drenched in fear sweat, gloves torn, face veil reflecting a face of terror and horror. Everything is covered in dust and dirt. 

Asoka: *"Mom...Dad...Pippa...Io...Jeshua...why??"*

We see Asoka clench their fist, then throw up their head, struggle to stand. 

Asoka: *"Must...reach...the next...Haven!"*

### Page 2

**"2116: Green Haven Clarksville, North America"**

**"Earlier that morning..."**

We see a fist holding a bunch of wheat straws, and another hand reaching for a straw. 

Pippa, off-panel: **"*Aw, *seriously*?*"**

We see a crowd of Biononymous children gathered in a outdoor pavilion with a dirt floor, all wearing the compulsory clothing of their cult: a simple sleeveless shirt and baggy trousers in the style of [shalwar kameez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalwar_kameez); a light long sleeve jacket, loose and fastening up the front, covered in a variety of simple geometric embroidery patterns, sleeves cinched at the wrists; gloves tucked into the sleeves; head veil with identical cartoon schematics of a face embroidered onto each with eSyrup thread; boots, with the trousers tucked in. Each child also has an eSyrup mechapet curled around their arms, legs, necks; sitting on heads, shoulders; or eagerly following their heels. Some of the children have straws of varying lengths in their hands. One child, smaller than the rest of the other children, a mechapet shaped like an American Crow sitting on their shoulder, is holding a very short straw, and the face on their head veil is a definite pout. 

Pippa: **"*I did the far hill field *yesterday*!*"**

Biononymous child holding the fist of straws: **"*Come on Pippa, we all agreed we would pick by straws today.*"**

Pippa: **"*But it's not fair, Io! I'm the smallest, and it's so far away!*"**

Io: **"*We all agreed!*"**

We see gloved hands try to shove the short straw back into the fist of straws. 

Pippa: **"*Take it back, let me pick again!*"**

A taller, lankier Biononymous child, a cuttlefish mechapet curled around their neck, steps in between them and calmly separates them. 

Asoka: **"*Come on, Pippa, I'll help you.*"**

### Page 3

Asoka and Pippa roll two large plastic barrels on a grassy path up a steep, terraced hill, towards a long row of tall greenhouses. The barrels are heavy with water and the two children lean their whole bodies into the endeavor. The cuttlefish mechapet holds two large woven shade-fans over the children's heads, while the crow mechapet moves sticks and other obstacles out of their path. 

Pippa: **"*Io was cheating, I know it! They haven't had to work further away than the apple trees ever since we started trying out all of their 'work assignment algorithms'.*"**

Asoka: **"*It's only been a week...maybe you've just had bad luck?*"**

Pippa: **"*Why do *I* always have the bad luck? Can't it go bother someone else sometime?*"**

At the top of the path, slightly above the row of greenhouses, is a row of spigots with hose attachments. Asoka is carefully placing their barrel against a rusted metal barrel holder. Pippa, whose barrel is already placed in a barrel holder, is crouched in front of their barrel, struggles with the hose attachments to their barrel. 

Pippa: **"*These are always so hard to do with gloves...*"**

Asoka: **"*Here, let me help...*"**

### Page 4

Asoka: **"*Wanna know a secret to making your luck better?*"**

Pippa: **"*Yes!*"**

Asoka: **"*Before picking a straw, or rolling dice, think of the worst possible outcome.*"**

Pippa: **"*What, the worst?!*"**

Asoka: **"*Then think about how you would get what you want even if you had the worst luck, and shout in your head, 'I don't care if the worst happens! I can handle it!'*"**

### Page 5

Asoka: **"*Then the bad luck gets scared, and knows it can't have fun with you.*"**

The two children watch the water flow through the gravity-powered aquaduct system, gently scattering moisture onto the plants inside the greenhouse. 

Asoka: **"*I heard Jeshua's making butter buns today...*"**

Pippa looks miserable. 

Pippa: **"*We're so far away, they'll be cold by the time we get back. Why do we have a grove all the way up here anyway?*"**

Asoka smiles kindly via their face veil. 

Asoka: **"*Some of these plants need more sun than they'd get in the valley...*"**

Asoka: **"*If I take care of the weeding, will you run back now and bring me a hot bun?*"**

Pippa beams with joy and gratitude. 

Pippa: **"*Really? Yes!*"**

Pippa runs off, crow mechapet flying overhead. 

Pippa: **"*Thanks Soka! Come on Manut!*"**

### Page 6

Asoka looks at their cuttlefish mechapet, hands resolutely on their hips. 

Asoka: **"*Alright, Iri, let's do this!*"**

Iri chirps with happy determination, holding up weeding trowels in its arms in a celebratory gesture. 

Iri: **"Yeah!"**

Panels show Asoka and Iri weeding the plants in the greenhouse. 

### Page 7

Asoka: **"*All done!*"**

Asoka wipes their brow. 

Asoka: **"*We must've worked fast if Pippa's still not back--*"**

Suddenly Iri shrieks and goes completely white. Iri begins broadcasting in the generic synthetic voices used by the Biononymous outside the privacy of their home structures. 

Iri: **"*This is an emergency broadcast from Green Haven Clarksville, we are under attack! Repeat, *WE ARE UNDER ATTACK*--Aaaaaaaaahh!!!---(scream cuts off with a sickening gurgle)*"**

Iri collapses into a grey puddle as Asoka rushes over, face veil revealing their terror. 

Asoka: **"*Attack?!*"**

Iri suddenly re-animates and broadcasts another voice not its own. 

Iri: **"Soka, stay away, don't come back!!"**

Asoka grabs Iri, aghast to hear...

Asoka: **"*Mom??!!*"**

Iri/Soka's Mom: **"It's the Death Dogs!! Run Soka! *RUN!!*"**

### Page 8

It's night. A village with a central housing structure identical to Asoka's home village, also surrounded by greenhouses, sleeps tranquilly amongst rolling hills. A faint orange glow is visible in one corner of the central housing structure. 

Eireena, off-panel: **"I'm so sorry for your loss, Asoka."**

Inside, Asoka is kneeling, head bowed. They are wearing clean trousers and sleeveless shirt, but their feet, hands, and head are bare. Asoka's long reddish hair is tied back in a half ponytail, and Iri, now displaying a reddish back and cream coloured bottom to better camouflage from its perch on Asoka's neck, peers out from under Asoka's hair. Before Asoka is a large steaming mug of hot tea, but Asoka hasn't touched it. Tears run down their face, past an upper lip that shows just the tiniest hints of fuzzy hair. 

We see Eireena, an older woman of the Biononymous, silver haired, wrinkled face showing deep sorrow, sitting on a floor cushion and wearing an elaborately embroidered jacket. On either side of her sit two other adult Biononymous: a man and a woman, somewhat younger than Eireena. The man looks at Asoka, his face betraying heartbroken sympathy for Asoka and anxious worry about the situation as a whole. The woman's face is one of calm contemplation. 

They are all sitting inside a warmly lit room with a shrine centered along one wall. All of the walls are covered in tapestries, made with the finest of the Biononymous' textile and embroidery. The shrine is a figure dressed in the religious clothing of the Biononymous, legs folded into a lotus and one hand raised, akin to the Buddha, but instead of holding the palm forward, the wrist is bent and the palm is cupped, just enough to hold a bit of soil and a tiny seedling, just beginning to sprout. The figurine is surrounded by candles, incense, and early summer blossoms. 

Eireena: **"I don't think any of the Biononymous anticipated that very many other animals would survive The Burning, especially large carnivores...it's quite strange, actually...but we will need to consider how to protect the Green Havens from these 'Death Dogs'."**

The fabric flap to this room opens, and another Biononymous adult enters. He addresses Eireena.

Biononymous man: **"Apologies, High Priestess, but World Government Peacekeepers have just arrived. They request an audience with you immediately."**

The other woman, sitting beside Eireena, raises an eyebrow. 

Biononymous woman: **"Immediately? At this indecent hour?"** 

Eireena: **"It's alright. Charlie, please let the Peacekeepers know I'll be with them shortly."**

Charlie bows and exits. Eireena stands, with assistance from the other two Biononymous adults, and looks down at Asoka, who is still kneeling with their head down, unable to look up or stand, tears streaming down their face. 

Eireena: **"It seems these days are full of the strange and indecent. Asoka has sanctuary with us, but perhaps it would be best to keep their presence here...discreet."**

Eireena puts on her face veil. 

Eireena: **"Fili, please escort Asoka to the infirmary and see to their needs. Serena, please come with me."**

Fili and Serena both bow: **"Yes, High Priestess."**

It is the next morning. Asoka sits on the edge of their bed in the infirmary, a thick, sturdy mattress in the style of Japanese futons, on a [tatami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatami)-style floor. Asoka's bare feet are on the tatami, knees bent under their folded arms, in which they rest their head. Iri tenderly combs Asoka's hair with their arms. 

Fili pushes back the door tapestry to Asoka's room, carrying a tray of food. Fili is also barefoot and without his face veil or jacket. 

Fili: **"Good morning. Did you sleep at all?"**

Asoka, without looking up, straightens their back and lowers their knees into a cross-legged sitting position. They look too dejected to talk. Iri timidly peers at Fili from around Asoka's hair. 

Iri: **"We slept a little."**

Fili sets down the tray and sits across from Asoka, whose eyes have started to leak tears again. Fili looks at Asoka sadly, then gives a little smile. 

Fili: **"Fresh raspberries? Just picked them this morning."**

Asoka still shows no reaction. Fili's smile drops and he looks down. 

Fili: **"I have a child about your age...I can't imagine them going through what you've gone through...It's ok to feel pain, but please, you must eat. It would dishonour your entire Haven if you were to starve yourself to death."**

Asoka finally looks at Fili. After a moment, Asoka reaches for a raspberry. Fili smiles encouragingly. 

### Page 11

A scratch at the door. Eireena enters with Serena. Fili stands and bows. Asoka also stands, abruptly remembering their manners, and knocks over the raspberries. Asoka looks mortified. 

Asoka: **"Oh no! I'm so sorry!"**

Asoka rushes to pick up the scattered raspberries. Eireena holds up a hand to stop Asoka and smiles as Serena calmly gathers the rest of the raspberries, which mostly scattered in her direction anyway. 

Eireena: **"Please, eat those, and sit."**

Serena returns the raspberries to their bowl, and they all sit, Asoka on their bed futon, the others on sitting cushions. 

Eireena: **"Asoka, I want to tell you why the Peacekeepers visited us last night. Is this something you think you can hear right now?"**

Asoka looks at Eireena, suddenly scared. 

Eireena: **"If you hear what I have to say, and all you want is to hide someplace safe for the rest of your life, I guarantee that you will have that place with us. Do you understand?"**

Asoka: **"Yes."**

### Page 12

Eireena: **"Good. Last night, the Peacekeepers told our Haven Council that they had received multiple reports of Green Havens being attacked by large wolf-like creatures."**

A panel of flashback: the salivating fangs, the terribly cold eyes, a sense of impossibly fast movement for something so large. 

Eireena: **"The Peacekeepers claim that although they can track these creatures, the creatures move too quickly for the Peacekeepers to hunt them down. Nonetheless, the Peacekeepers offered to station a platoon of 40 Peacekeepers at our Green Haven as protection, in case the creatures try to attack us."**

Eireena lets her cynicism creep onto her face. 

Eireena: **"Though we do not trust their motives in the slightest, we have little choice...your story confirms the terrifying results of having no protection against these 'Death Dogs'. So we will have Peacekeepers at our Green Haven, and soon, I fear that no Green Haven will be without World Government military presence. I don't think I need to say how much this will compromise our dedication to anonymity and a life free from surveillance."**

Eireena now looks hard at Asoka. 

Eireena: **"If you take your sanctuary with us, this is the life we forsee having to accept. However...if you feel able to travel a more dangerous and risky, but potentially greatly rewarding path...there is another option."**
