"A long time ago..."

"before the Orbiters lived in the sky,"

"before we hid underground to survive The Burning,"

"we all lived together, on the Earth's surface."

"We could all breathe the air,"

"drink the water,"

"feel the sun."

"We were all... 

"FREE."

### Page 1

**"2066: São Paulo, Brazil"**

**"It was a day of hope and wonder."** 

**"The Space Consortium had just announced the completion of their third space farm, **THE UPPER ESTATES SPACE ARBORETUM**. The news feeds were drowning in photos of the ribbon-cutting event up in orbit, of beautiful, important people draped in gorgeously fashionable and unspeakably expensive formal attire, eSyrup fabric programmed to fluidly change colours in response to the lights, the music, their wearers' moods..."**

**"...of delicate, mouth-watering hors d'oeuvres made from the succulent crops grown and cultivated at the two older space farms, with their carefully filtered water and pristine soil..."**

**"...of the fleet of orbiting home pods that synchronised their velocities with the new arboretum in order to snag front row seats to this historic moment, when humanity proved its ingenuity once more..."**

**"...for the world was becoming too dirty, too extreme in its weather, to support industrial planetside farming..."**

**"...and many people, on this historic day of hope and wonder, were starving..."**

Under this narration, we see a young Majhee walking briskly through the crowded streets of São Paulo. Everyone is wearing what looks like light-weight full-body hazmat suits, flickering a bit as the eSyrup in the material absorbs dangerous radiation in the air, hoods up, breathing masks and googles on. The air is hazy with smog, the sky a smeared grey-blue, the mid-morning sun pale. As Majhee passes shops and cafes, the daily news appears in hologram-like projections that occupy the ceilings or hover at standing-head-height. Other humans have tiny projections coming from subdermally implanted chips in their wrists, palms, ears, or foreheads; these projections surround their wrists, palms, ears, or face with a sphere of light, either sonifying or visualising entertainment, memories, mental models, dreams, news, scholarly publications. 

A lot of the news is about the new space arboretum, but most of the individual **INFO-SPHERE**s are focused on news about planetside climate disasters: 
* The Colorado River has dried up completely and the severe drought is causing mass migrations to east, causing massive overcrowding in major inland ("mid-western") cities.
* Last year's total evaporation of the River Niger has heightened ethnic tensions in the area and armed conflict is escalating.
* An extremely aggressive water-borne disease wipes out several major urban areas in China and India 
* Illnesses from sun radiation, such as skin cancer, have a thousand-fold jump in rate of diagnosis around the world.

*(cite the above news stories)*

### Page 2

We see Majhee walk past a large research facility, metal and glass architecture dully gleaming in the smoggy light, labeled "Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública". The front of the research facility is teeming with protesters, who hold signs and wave flags with slogans like "Não sirva aos tiranos em órbita!", "Educar crianças humanas, não máquinas corporativas!", and "Alimentar humanos não foguetes!" *(need to put translations of these phrases in footnotes)*

Majhee sneaks into an alleyway to enter the research facility via a back door. We see a receptionist sitting behind a sealed glass window. Next to him is a decontamination chamber that all must pass thru in order to enter the research facility. 

Receptionist: **"Dr. Suh! How bad is it out there?"**

Majhee takes off her hood and googles and we see her face - pretty and youthful for her 41 years, if it weren't for the lines of worry and grim determination. She shakes out her hair, cropped short in a bowl pixie cut. Clearly burdened with many troubles, she begins taking off her eSyrup hazmat suit.  

Majhee: **"Still crowded."**

Receptionist: **"Idiots. Don't they understand we're trying to help?"**

Majhee: **"Well, they're hungry. Can't think when you're hungry."**

Majhee removes her boots and steps into the decontamination chamber.

### Page 3

Majhee stands in her office, seemingly floating in the center of a giant transparent bacteria made of light. The light model of the bacteria is exquisitely detailed, and a section of the nucleoid is blown up for closer inspection. Majhee's fingers are raised in a well-practiced yet complicated gesture. Her face is darkened with barely contained rage. 

Off panel: **"Majhee, you can't *scoop* the *Space Consortium*..."**

Majhee: **"For the last time, Marcia, it's not scooping if I'm making everything freely accessible!"**

We see Marcia Netto, President of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, in Majhee's doorway, rubbing her forehead with exasperation.

Marcia: **"You know what I mean. They are *determined* to make money off eSyrup applications, and when you post your lab's developments online under a Creative Commons license, you make that application of eSyrup tech *unpatentable*."**

Majhee: **"Exactly."**

Marcia: **"But you saw what they did with after our collaboration to develop eSyrup fuel! This institute cannot afford another round of legal action like that!"**

### Page 4

Majhee angrily turns off the giant bacteria of light with an impatient gesture as she turns to Marcia, furious.

Majhee: **"*You* pushed that collaboration through, against my numerous objections!"** 

Marcia, immediately apologetic, hands up to ward off Majhee's anger

Marcia: **"I know, I *know*, that was definitely my mistake, and I'm *sorry*."**

Majhee interrupts: **"And stop talking like you actually *believe* in propriatary health research! How is it possible that *anyone* can still hold such *archaic* views?"**

Marcia, defeated: **"*sigh*. Just...be careful."** 

Marcia looks over her shoulder, then turns back to Majhee.

Marcia, low and careful: **"There are rumors that the Space Consortium is trying to *weaponize* eSyrup. I know I sound like a conspiracy theorist, but..."**

Majhee, incredulous: **"They wouldn't dare--"**

Felix, a scientist in Majhee's lab, appears at the doorway, breathless and distraught.

Felix: **"Majhee, my father-- President Netto!"**

Majhee: **"I'm sorry Marcia, we'll have to continue this another time."**

### Page 5

Majhee, Felix, and other members of Majhee's research group sit or stand in a cluster at one end of their lab benches in an upper floor of the research institute. The wall nearest to them is a floor-to-ceiling window, showing the dusty sky-line of São Paulo. The sun sits in a reddish hazy sky, just past the midday zenith. 

Majhee: **"So. Your father has been diagnosed again."**

The circle of researchers: **Felix Grael**, a pale but handsome man in his late 20s, raised in Rio de Janeiro by Swedish immigrants who have since returned to Europe, his face lined with fear and sadness, head in hands as his elbows rest on his knees; **Kai Oliveira**, a much older woman of Japanese-Portuguese descent, grey-haired and hook-nosed, stern-faced and sitting stiffly in her chair; **Beatriz Cavalcanti**, a tall woman in her 30s, a Brazilian of Italian descent, mouth set in a grim line even as her hands squeeze Felix's shoulders in a motherly, comforting gesture; **Breno Leite**, a dark, thin man in his early 30s, born and raised in the streets of São Paulo by his young Brazilian single mother, who worked every day of her life before falling ill in order to send her son to university; **Nova Jatobá**, a young graduate student in her mid-20s, descended from indiginous Brazilians from deeper inland, her plump face lined with exhaustion; **Iara Gracie**, another young grad student in her mid-20s, who was born into an old Brazilian martial arts family but chose the life of a scientist instead; **Vec Barbosa**, a portly Brazilian man of West African descent in his 40s, hands resignedly folded over a substantial beer belly, face troubled and sad behind a rather bushy yet neatly-trimmed beard.

Vec, to Felix: **"Beatriz and I have already contacted your father's medical team in Sweden, and we've given them access to our database on repeat skin cancer patients. This will greatly improve his chances of recovery, but..."**

Beatriz, kindly: **"We also remember that your father had a liver transplant last year. If you want to go home to be with your family, everyone will understand."**

Felix now looks up, straight at Majhee, eyes full of furious determination.

Felix: **"There's nothing I can do there anyway...besides, we need to finish the biofilm project! *Before* Space Consortium can get their filthy hands on another patent!"**

Felix covers his face with his hands, furious at the tears that have started to stream down his face.

Beatriz: **"I'm sure we could manage--"**

Kai, arms folded, looking down at her lap with hard eyes.

Kai: **"We can't finish this project in time without Felix. We all know splicing's more art than algorithm, and ever since my hands starting hurting too much, Felix is our *best*."**

Kai's brow furrows with frustration. 

Kai: **"Although...our best may not be enough...Space Consortium announced a few days ago their eSyrup-spliced halobacterium solar cell, and thus, just patented all eSyrup-based photovoltaic cells. Also, this morning I got *this*."** 

Kai passes up a small card to Majhee. Majhee reads from it.

Majhee: **"'You've been slapped on the wrists. Don't make us go for your throat.'"**

Nova, looking terrified: **"What's that supposed to mean??"**

Kai: **"Space Consortium's telling us to stop competing with them. Suing us for exclusive patents on eSyrup fuel was the slap on the wrists."**

### Page 6

Everyone takes a moment to imagine what it might be like if Space Consortium went for their throats. 

Iara: **"My grandfather called this morning...he told me he was offered 10 billian reais last week to convince me to report our unpublished work."**

Felix: **"What??"**

Iara: **"Apparently that wasn't the first time either...he got a similar offer last year as well, but he thought it wasn't worth mentioning because he knew I wouldn't go for it."**

Nova, aghast: **"10 billion reais...that's more than the institute's endowment..."** 

Breno: **"It's worth it. A stable splice with a bacterial colony is the first step towards splicing eSyrup with human cells, and if Space Consortium can manage to patent living splices, they'll have a monopoly on all future clinical and medical applications of eSyrup."**

We see Breno's moody, cynical eyes. 

Breno: **"But I'm sure 10 billion is nothing to a trust-fund baby like you, Iara..."**

Felix: **"Come on Breno! You know *none* of us would sell-out to Space Consortium!"**

Breno, smiles ruefully, eyes pitying: **"Really? That kind of money would give my mother the same quality of treatment that your father gets for free in Sweden. What makes you think I wouldn't give in to a temptation like that?"**

Felix: **"Well then good thing Majhee is paying the doctors' bribes for your mother, yeah?! If Iara is privileged, then so are you!"**

We see the circle of researchers sitting in silence, betraying varying degrees of discomfort and fear.

### Page 7 

Majhee: **"I can't...*ask* anyone to stay. We all know the risks that come with working on this project, with working in this city right now. We all have family to protect."**

Majhee: **"But...*personally*...I can't give up now. If we don't get these eSyrup protocols into the public domain, many will suffer because they can't pay Space Consortium's price."**

Majhee: **"If you feel you must leave, I will do what I can to help you and your family get out of this city, and off Space Consortium's radar."**

Majhee: **"If you stay...I will forever owe you a debt of gratitude...and I swear, I will protect you and your families in any way that I can."**

**"6 months later: Massachusetts, USA"**

We see rolling countryside, vibrant with autumn colors, behind a low row of concrete warehouses, labeled "Morei Textiles". 

Off-panel, secretary: **"Iúna, the folks from the World Health Organization are here."**

Off-panel, Iúna: **"Thanks, I'll be with them in a moment."**

We see the inside of a warehouse, where long rows of industrial looms weave eSyrup textiles. Their combined activity generates a gently deafening **"WHIRRRRR"**. Iúna Morei, a tall shapely American woman of Portuguese descent in her early 30s, lustrous wavy brown hair pulled up into a bun, an infant with thick black hair strapped to her front, walks briskly and confidently away from a door labeled "Quiet Room" towards a group of humans waiting near the main entrance of the warehouse. 

Iúna smiles and yells as she waves towards her office door, just next to the entrance to the warehouse and labeled "Iúna Morei, CEO of Morei Textiles".

Iúna: **"HELLO! SHALL WE STEP INTO MY OFFICE?"**

### Page 8

Iúna: **"Thank you for bringing the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols from São Paulo."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"You know, you'd get these updates a lot faster if you'd just get an **INFO-SPHERE** mod..."**

Iúna: **"Dr. Kauffmann, I'm sure your colleagues can tell you how adamantly opposed I am to body modifications and eSyrup implants. I'm extremely grateful that you've taken the time to travel all the way from DC today."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Well, we were in Boston for an emergency conference, so it wasn't too much trouble. Besides, no one can beat your MERV filter efficiency ratings, not with sheer fabrics at least. I've got your organzas in every window of my house."**

Iúna: **"Just doing what we can. What was the emergency conference about?"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"They're preparing themselves for a huge wave of refugees."**

Iúna: **"Really? From where?"**

Under this dialogue is a view of Iúna's desk. We see sneak peek's of the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols visualized with light, a floating sphere controlled by a thick piece of eSyrup canvas, stretched on a semi-circular frame that, when Iúna stands inside of it, places the canvas at about hip height, easy to reach while standing. Either one large image or many very close-up views. 

### Page 9

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Didn't you hear? A police raid in L.A. this morning started a huge fire that's spread halfway up the coast of California. It's so big it's getting blown over the mountains into Arizona by high winds. Everything out there is bone dry ever since the Colorado River disappeared."**

Iúna: **"What?? How many dead??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Unfortunately we haven't had a chance to count yet. Thousands are already homeless."**

Iúna: **"How does a police raid start a state-wide fire??"**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"It's all the plastic furniture - they're basically *solid* petroleum, turns a misplaced candle into a fireball in just *minutes*. And LA to San Francisco is so packed with cheap cookie-cutter homes, in retrospect, I'm amazed this didn't happen sooner. I'm sorry, I should have realised you wouldn't have heard yet...do you know anyone over there?"**

Iúna: **"Yes, I...I'm sorry I need to make a call..."**

Dr. Kauffmann: **"Of course. I'll see myself out."**

Under this dialogue we see close-up views of the baby strapped to Iúna's front. The child is a little less than one year old. The strapping is an intricately folded piece of eSyrup cloth that can amplify the baby's heartrate, breathing, and digestive sounds. 

### Page 10

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, have you been able to contact Joshua Tree?*"**

Iúna is outside, and her baby is no longer strapped to her chest. Instead, her face is covered in a thick veil and she wears what looks like a heavy, full-sleeved and full-length apron. eSyrup circuits flash within the weave of both Iúna's veil and apron. She stands, facing west, arms flung out wide, back straight and tall, legs apart, boots planted wide in the frosty grass. 

Iúna's Biononymous contact at Green Haven Tahoe: **"*Negative, Mama Bird.*"**

Iúna: **"*How is Tahoe?*"**

Tahoe: **"*Fire hasn't gotten further than Fresno, but we're getting ready to offer sanctuary.*"**

Iúna: **"*So...it *was* the body mod.*"**

Tahoe: **"*Looks like it. They didn't even bother going for the decoy.*"**

### Page 11

Iúna ponders for a moment, her face furrowed with grief and concentration.

Iúna: **"*Tahoe, I've changed my mind. I vote for registering as a religion.*"**

Tahoe: **"*Wa-wait, seriously?*"**

Iúna: **"*Yes. We need all of the protections we can get right now.*"**

Tahoe: **"*You've been thinking about what Pigsah said at our last TeleSensing?*"**

Iúna: **"*Yes. They were right - it's relatively easy right now to live without body mods. But once all the schools require every student to get an **INFO-SPHERE** mod, once every industry requires employees to use body mods in order to be qualified for the job...our children **won't** have a choice. They'll have to list their body mods on their CV, you just won't be a qualified human *adult* if you don't have a body mod.*"**

Tahoe: **"*But...declaring ourselves a religion...it just feels like we're setting ourselves up for all the pitfalls of a *cult*.*"**

Iúna: **"*I know, and that's why I intially voted against it. But if we want defend our right to live without constant surveillance, we can't just empower individual decisions without thinking about how to co-exist with the rest of society. If we don't take drastic measures, in just 10 years our social structures will make it *impossible* to live without constant surveillance.*"**

### Page 12

Tahoe: **"*But we still haven't figured out our own solutions to the really *practical* advantages of body mods...long-distance communication, ways to aid our memories and gain perspective on our behaviour...*"**

Iúna: **"*That's why I've changed my mind. Our eSyrup research needs to expand, and it needs to stay under the radar. Tahoe, you know what that research group in Brazil published last month?*"**

Tahoe: **"*What?*"**

Iúna: **"*The first successful splice of eSyrup with a living organic compound, a recipe for creating eSyrup *biofilm*!*"**

Tahoe: **"*...Sorry Mama Bird, I don't follow eSyrup research like you do. Why should I care about biofilm?*"**

Iúna: **"*Because that's the *beginning*. Those bastards managed it before Space Consortium, got it published before Space Consortium could patent it. Do you remember how we once talked of synthetic companion creatures, that can act like portable, non-invasive **INFO-SPHERES**?*"**

Tahoe: **"*...yes...?*"**

Iúna: **"It's possible now. *If they can splice eSyrup with a microcolony of bacteria, then we can figure out how to splice eSyrup into bigger, more complex living things. And if creating and interacting with these creatures is part of our religious practice...*"**

Iúna: **"*...then we have much stronger grounds to deny oversight by Space Consortium, or any national government!*"**

### Page 1

**"2067: Ushuaia, Argentina"**

We see a bustling harbour town, everything about it small and cute except for the occassional warehouse factory or modern high rise office building - these were clearly very recent additions to a place that otherwise hadn't changed very much in many hundreds of years.

**"When growing a personal supply of eSyrup, say, for research or for fun, you can feed it enough silica just by running down to the beach once a week with a soup bowl."**

**"Industrialized eSyrup production, however, needs quite a bit of silica."**

**"Sand mining was out of the question, given the Space Consortium's concern with their image - wouldn't want their brand tarnished by news of their operations destroying delicate coastal ecosystems or picturesque beachside communities."**

**"So they turned to the next biggest source of biogenic silica - deep-sea deposits in the [Antarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenic_silica#Major_silica_sinks_in_the_modern_oceans)."**

We see close-ups of the [wildlife at Green Haven Cabo de Hornos](https://youtu.be/06LcgVQg7Yk) with tumultuous ocean and raw, mountainous landscape. Off in the distance, we see a tiny speck on the horizon - a deep-sea silica mining rig. A tiny plume of smoke, looking both innocent and foreboding, curls up from the rig. 

### Page 2

**"Ocean Acidification Monitoring Station, Roca Redonda, Galapagos Islands"**

Technician: **"Dr. Zambrano! Dr. Zambrano!"**

Dr. Zambrano: **"What is it?"**

Tech: **"The pH levels...do you see...!"**

Dr.Zambrano: **"Dios mío...how can it fall so fast??"**

*Cite [this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rising-acidity-in-the-ocean/).*

**"Thermohaline Circulation Observation Centre, Orkney Islands"**

Woman with powerful thighs: **"Members of the UN, thank you for your time today. The TCO has been tracking the temperature, salinity, and flow rates of the major ocean currents in the North Atlantic Ocean for the last 40 years, and we have incredibly troubling news to share with you today."**

### Page 3

A room-sized **INFO-SPHERE** creates photonic representations of several government leaders around the world. A tall, hook-nosed woman with incredibly built thighs walks through a 3-dimensional video recording of rivers and waterfalls *pouring* off of a glacier into the wider ocean surrounding it. Overlayed with light are labels with meta data and more in-depth treatments of certain phenomena being shown in the video, appearing when one of the photonic representations of government leaders move their gaze over that part of the video. 

*(cite [this article](https://www.wunderground.com/resources/climate/abruptclimate.asp) and [the wikipedia page on thermohaline circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation))*

Woman with powerful thighs: **"As you can see from the videos of our remote sensor buoy, the influx of fresh water from melting glaciers is shoving an incredible amount of fresh water into the North Sea, enough that it is highly likely to shut down global ocean current circulations. This will trigger very abrupt and very signficant changes to annual average temperatures worldwide, which will in turn strain our food and water resources."**

Woman with powerful thighs: **"In short, things are about to get *very* bad."**

### Page 4

**"São Paulo, Brazil"**

The orderly protest crowds in front of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública are gone, replaced by utter chaos. Everyone on the street is now wearing industrial filter respirators and knee-length rubber water boots - the streets are ankle-deep in acidic ocean water, highly dosed with nitric acid. We see Majhee, fully dressed in protective gear and a breathing mask, weave her way through a crowd and rush into the front door of the research institute. 

Majhee: *"2 months ago, when NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) levels in São Paulo were declared 20 times above the World Health Organisation's most recent recommended thresholds for outdoor air quality, Felix and his family moved back to Sweden..."*

Majhee: *"1 month ago, when the ocean started to give you mild chemical burns if you swam for too long, Breno moved with his mother back to her hometown, just north of Brasilia..."*

Majhee: *"11 days ago, hours after we celebrated the birth of Nimh, our first live birth of a mouse spliced with raw eSyrup, Iara was found on a rooftop in Centro, seemingly shot through the skull, but the bullet was never found..."*

### Page 5

Kai, Beatriz, Nova, and Vec are in the same area where they were having a lab meeting, last we saw them - now they are frantically packing lab equipment and eSyrup cultures, and copying research notes then deleting/shredding/destroying them. Off to one side is an unfamiliar older man and a teenaged boy keeping two very young children out of the fray. The teenaged boy looks related to Nova. The two young children look related to the unfamiliar older man and Beatriz, one looking about 6 and the other looking about 3. The little one has short hair, tied into a puffy short ponytail at the very top of her head; the older one has long straight hair that just brushes his shoulders; they both stare at the frantic activity with wide eyes. 

Majhee: **"We need to finish packing up NOW."**

Vec pulls aside Majhee. Vec looks incredibly troubled.  

Vec: **"Majhee, what do we with Nimh??"**

Majhee: **"What's her condition?"**

Vec: **"Her esophogus and trachea. They didn't join properly, there's a leak. I don't think Sonic Hedgehog(cite) is a viable vector, too much depends on it, and the range is too small."**

Majhee: **"What range?"**

Vec: **"Of variation from the normal molecular structure that we can induce on it and *still* end up with a molecule that can do *everything* that Sonic Hedgehog *needs* to do(cite)!!"**

### Page 6

Majhee places a hand on Vec's shoulder to calm him. 

Majhee: **"How big of a leak? Can we patch it?"**

Vec: **"It's thin but *long*, almost the whole length of the connection. Nova wants to try, Kai and Beatriz think it will take too long, and won't buy us much time anyway."**

Vec looks emotionally wrecked. 

Vec: **"I will help Nova, if you think it's a good idea."**

Majhee stares at the pouring rain outside, the streets below awash with sea water, lost belongings, and garbage. People with insufficient protection from the nitric acid heavy water are screaming and bleeding. After a long silence, Majhee speaks softly.

Majhee: **"There is no more time left to buy. Even if we fix the leak, how will we transport a dying transgenic mouse through nitric acid rain and flood(cite)?"**

Majhee: **"Give her 20 microliters of NaP(cite), and send all of our data to Sweden. Felix will have more time to experiment."**

### Page 7

Majhee turns back to the rest of the room and greets the older man with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He gives Majhee a tired smile. 

Majhee: **"Glad you're here, Demetrio, how are you?"**

Demetrio: **"As well as one can be, given the situation."**

Majhee hugs the teenaged boy. 

Majhee: **"And Amana, are you alright?"**

Amana looks terrified, and nearly crying from the effort of keeping his cool in front of the smaller children. 

Amana: **"Dr. Suh, where are we going?"**

### Page 8

Majhee squats to be eye level with the two little children, and gathers them and Amana around her. Demetrio crouches behind the two little ones and places a comforting hand on the boy's shoulder. Majhee smiles extra brightly at the little girl. 

Majhee: **"Right! Nicola, Nerio, we are going walk *very far*, to [a farm on a mountain with a flat top, like a table](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mato-Grosso-Plateau)! But on the way, the floor is lava, and the rain is lava, so we need to keep the lava *off* of our skins, *no matter what*. Do you understand?"**

Nicola squeels and smiles shyly, raising her arms and hiding her face in her father's knee. Nerio nods somber-faced, one hand on his father's other knee. 

Majhee shifts her attention to Amana. 

Majhee: **"Do you remember our last lab retreat, when we all went SCUBA diving? You're gonna come with me to bring the wetsuits up here."**

### Page 9

**"In the year 2067, the safety valves on the Space Consortium's deep-sea silica harvesting rig in the Antarctic failed to activate, spewing partially distilled volcanic fumes and biogenic silica into the southern ocean currents. The disaster belched a huge cloud of hydrogen flouride into the [West Wind Drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circumpolar_Current), mixing the highly corrosive gas into an already critically damaged atmosphere, and transforming the surrounding ocean into a deadly sea of hydroflouric acid."**

**"The poisonous cloud blinded many of the rig's crew, and the hydroflouric acid boiled anyone who fell into the ocean. The catastrophe claimed the lives of *every* living soul on the harvesting rig, and for weeks, the deep-sea volcanic plumes belched unchecked into the Antarctic Convergence."**

### Page 10

**"Everyone fled underground, trying to hide from the huge clouds of poisonous gas and acid rain that were sweeping around the globe in terrifyingly large and frequent cyclones."**

On a backdrop of the "Earth as a marble in space" image, showing intense cyclonic activity. Over this backdrop, we see: 
* Iúna and her son João queue in line to beg asylum in caves in Vermont to escape the huge clouds of NO2. 
* Amadou and his parents flee to the caves beneath Santarém, in the Pará province of Brazil. 

### Page 11

**"Amid the chaos, nearly 60,000 planetside humans fled into orbit on the Space Consortium's Space Barges."**

A huge crowd of desperate people try to shove themselves onto three enormous Space Barges, but it's clear that even these behemoth vessels will not fit everyone in the launch station. The Space Barge launch station staff try to maintain order but everyone is in a hysterical panic. Three of the Space Barges have already closed their doors and are firing up its engines. 

There are nearly 10 additional empty launch pads, but they are all empty. 

Person in the crowd: **"Why aren't the other barges coming back???"**

The last Space Barge begins to close its doors. People totally lose their shit. 

PA: **"Please step away from the safety barrier!! Please step AWAY from the safety barrier!!"**

**"Afraid to take on more refugees than they could safely host in orbit, the Space Consortium shut down the Space Barge shuttle service, 'until further notice'."**

### Page 12

**"That 'further notice' came 2 years later, when the Orbiters returned to Earth to declare themselves, *'The World Government'*."**

## Chapter 3

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Eireena McLeland

### Page 1

4 jagged panels. 1st POV of running, terrified, through a harsh and rocky landscape. Flash of memory: enormous fangs; cold, blood-red eyes. A farming village in ruins, fires consuming the large interconnected home structures and surrounding greenhouses. Dead bodies, mangled by the monstrous wolf-like creatures that are the size of a small elephant. 

Asoka trips, falling face veil down in the dirt. Their mechapet, a synthetic creature made to look like a cuttlefish and brought alive using eSyrup technology, chitters frantically from where it is wrapped around Asoka's neck, sheet-white with fear. Asoka's clothes are drenched in fear sweat, gloves torn, face veil reflecting a face of terror and horror. Everything is covered in dust and dirt. 

Asoka: *"Mom...I sent...Pippa back...WHY??"*

We see Asoka clench their fist, then throw up their head, struggle to stand, eyes streaming with tears. 

Asoka: *"Must...reach...the next...Haven!"*

### Page 2

**"Earlier that morning..."**

**"2116: Green Haven Clarksville, North America"**

We see a fist holding a bunch of wheat straws, and another hand reaching for a straw. 

Pippa, off-panel: **"*Aw, *seriously*?*"**

We see a crowd of Biononymous children gathered in a outdoor pavilion with a dirt floor, all wearing the compulsory clothing of their cult: a simple sleeveless shirt and baggy trousers in the style of [shalwar kameez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalwar_kameez); a light long sleeve jacket, loose and fastening up the front, covered in a variety of simple geometric embroidery patterns, sleeves cinched at the wrists; gloves tucked into the sleeves; head veil with identical cartoon schematics of a face embroidered onto each with eSyrup thread; boots, with the trousers tucked in. Each child also has an eSyrup mechapet curled around their arms, legs, necks; sitting on heads, shoulders; or eagerly following their heels. Some of the children have straws of varying lengths in their hands. One child, smaller than the rest of the other children, a mechapet shaped like an American Crow sitting on their shoulder, is holding a very short straw, and the face on their head veil is a definite pout. 

Pippa: **"*I did the far hill field *yesterday*!*"**

Biononymous child holding the fist of straws: **"*Come on Pippa, we all agreed we would pick by straws today.*"**

Pippa: **"*But it's not fair, Io! I'm the smallest, and it's so far away!*"**

Io: **"*We all agreed!*"**

We see gloved hands try to shove the short straw back into the fist of straws. 

Pippa: **"*Take it back, let me pick again!*"**

A taller, lankier Biononymous child, a cuttlefish mechapet curled around their neck, steps in between them and calmly separates them. 

Asoka: **"*Come on, Pippa, I'll help you.*"**

### Page 3

Asoka and Pippa roll two large plastic barrels on a grassy path up a steep, terraced hill, towards a long row of tall greenhouses. The barrels are heavy with water and the two children lean their whole bodies into the endeavor. The cuttlefish mechapet holds two large woven shade-fans over the children's heads, while the crow mechapet moves sticks and other obstacles out of their path. 

Pippa: **"*No, *Soka-aa*, Io was cheating, I know it! They haven't had to work further away than the apple trees ever since we started trying out all of their 'work assignment algorithms'...*"**

Asoka: **"*It's only been a week...maybe you've just had bad luck?*"**

Pippa: **"*Why do *I* always have the bad luck? Can't it go bother someone else sometime?*"**

At the top of the path, slightly above the row of greenhouses, is a row of spigots with hose attachments. Asoka is carefully placing their barrel against a rusted metal barrel holder. Pippa, whose barrel is already placed in a barrel holder, is crouched in front of their barrel, struggles with the hose attachments to their barrel. 

Pippa: **"*These are always so hard to do with gloves...*"**

Asoka gives Pippa a wink and a thumbs up before tending to their own hose attachment.

Asoka: **"*You got this!*"**

### Page 4

Asoka: **"*Wanna know a secret to making your luck better?*"**

Pippa: **"*Yes!*"**

Asoka: **"*Before picking a straw, or rolling dice, think of the worst possible outcome.*"**

Pippa: **"*The worst?!*"**

Asoka: **"*Then think about how you would get what you want even if you had the worst luck, and shout in your head, 'I don't care if the worst happens! I can handle it!!'*"**

### Page 5

Asoka: **"*Then the bad luck gets scared, and knows it can't have fun with you.*"**

The two children watch the water flow through the gravity-powered aquaduct system, gently scattering moisture onto the plants inside the greenhouse. 

Asoka: **"*Smells like Jeshua's making butter buns today...*"**

Pippa looks miserable. 

Pippa: **"*We're so far away, they'll be cold by the time we get back. Why do we have a grove all the way up here anyway?*"**

Asoka smiles kindly via their face veil. 

Asoka: **"*Some of these plants need more sun than they'd get in the valley...*"**

Asoka crouches to be face level with Pippa.

Asoka: **"*If I take care of the weeding, will you run back now and bring me a hot bun?*"**

Pippa beams with joy and gratitude. 

Pippa: **"*Really? Yes!*"**

Pippa runs off, crow mechapet flying overhead. 

Pippa: **"*Thanks Soka! Come on Manut!*"**

### Page 6

Asoka looks at their cuttlefish mechapet, hands resolutely on their hips. 

Asoka: **"*Alright, Iri, let's do this!*"**

Iri chirps with happy determination, holding up weeding trowels in its arms in a celebratory gesture. 

Iri: **"Yeah!"**

Panels show Asoka and Iri weeding the plants in the greenhouse. Have some nice botany spreads of future plants that have been genetically engineered to deal with a heavy NO2 and CO2 content. The plants need to have ways of reducing their overgrowth thanks to the abundance of CO2 and they need to still sequester enough nutrients for them to be worth growing and eating. What do the 3 sisters (beans, corn, squash) need to change in order to still be a great trio?

### Page 7

Asoka: **"*All done!*"**

Asoka wipes their brow. 

Asoka: **"*We must've worked fast if Pippa's still not back--*"**

Suddenly Iri shrieks and goes completely white. Iri begins loudly broadcasting in the generic synthetic voices used by the Biononymous outside the privacy of their home structures. 

Iri: **"*This is an emergency broadcast from Green Haven Clarksville, we are under attack! Repeat, *WE ARE UNDER ATTACK*--Aaaaaaaaahh!!!---(scream cuts off with a sickening gurgle)*"**

Iri collapses into a grey puddle as Asoka rushes over, face veil revealing their terror. 

Asoka: **"*Attack?!*"**

Iri suddenly re-animates and broadcasts another voice not its own. 

Iri: **"Soka, stay away, don't come back!!"**

Asoka grabs Iri, aghast to hear...

Asoka: **"*Mom??!!*"**

Iri/Soka's Mom: **"It's the Death Dogs!! Run Soka! *RUN!!*"**

### Page 8

It's night. A village with a central housing structure identical to Asoka's home village, also surrounded by greenhouses, sleeps tranquilly amongst rolling hills and a soft, nearly full moon. A faint orange glow is visible in one corner of the central housing structure. 

Eireena, off-panel: **"I'm so sorry for your loss, Asoka."**

Inside, Asoka is kneeling, head bowed. They are wearing clean trousers and sleeveless shirt, but their feet, hands, and head are bare. Asoka's long reddish hair is tied back in a half ponytail, and Iri, now displaying a reddish back and cream coloured bottom to better camouflage from its perch on Asoka's neck, peers out from under Asoka's hair. Before Asoka is a large steaming mug of hot tea, but Asoka hasn't touched it. Tears run down their face, past an upper lip that shows just the tiniest hints of fuzzy hair. 

We see Eireena McLeland, High Priestess of the Biononymous and leader of this Green Haven, silver haired, wrinkled face showing deep sorrow, sitting on a floor cushion and wearing an elaborately embroidered jacket. On either side of her sit two other adult Biononymous: a man and a woman, somewhat younger than Eireena. The man looks at Asoka, his face betraying heartbroken sympathy for Asoka and anxious worry about the situation as a whole. The woman's face is one of calm contemplation. 

They are all sitting inside a warmly lit room with a shrine centered along one wall. All of the walls are covered in tapestries, made with the finest of the Biononymous' textile and embroidery. The shrine is a figure dressed in the religious clothing of the Biononymous, legs folded into a lotus and one hand raised, akin to the Buddha, but instead of holding the palm forward, the wrist is bent and the palm is cupped, just enough to hold a bit of soil and a tiny seedling, just beginning to sprout. The figurine is surrounded by non-combusting eSyrup candles and scent-only eSyrup incense, and early summer blossoms. 

Eireena: **"I don't think any of the Biononymous anticipated that very many other animals would survive The Burning, especially large carnivores...it's quite strange, actually...but we will need to consider how to protect the Green Havens from these 'Death Dogs'."**

### Page 9

The fabric flap to this room opens, and another Biononymous adult enters. He addresses Eireena.

Biononymous man: **"Apologies, High Priestess, but World Government Peacekeepers have just arrived. They request an audience with you immediately."**

The other woman, sitting beside Eireena, raises an eyebrow. Her eye has a hard glint.  

Biononymous woman: **"Immediately? At this indecent hour?"** 

Eireena: **"It's alright. Charlie, please let the Peacekeepers know I'll be with them shortly."**

Charlie bows and exits. Eireena stands and looks down at Asoka, who is still kneeling with their head down, unable to look up or stand, tears streaming down their face. 

Eireena: **"It seems these days are full of the strange and the indecent. Asoka has sanctuary with us, but perhaps it would be best to keep their presence here...discreet."**

Eireena puts on her face veil. 

Eireena: **"*Fili, please escort Asoka to the infirmary and see to their needs. Serena, please come with me.*"**

Fili and Serena both bow: **"Yes, High Priestess."**

### Page 10

It is the next morning. Asoka sits on the edge of their bed in the infirmary, a thick, sturdy mattress in the style of Japanese futons, on a [tatami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatami)-style floor. Asoka's bare feet are on the tatami, knees bent up under their folded arms, in which they rest their head. Their eyes are tired and puffy. Iri tenderly combs Asoka's hair with its arms. 

Fili pushes back the door tapestry to Asoka's room, carrying a tray of food. Fili is also barefoot and without his face veil or jacket. 

Fili: **"Good morning. Did you sleep at all?"**

Asoka, without looking up, straightens their back and lowers their knees into a cross-legged sitting position. They look too dejected to talk. Iri timidly peers at Fili from around Asoka's hair. 

Iri: **"We slept a little."**

Fili sets down the tray and sits across from Asoka, whose eyes have started to leak tears again. Fili looks at Asoka sadly, then gives a little smile. 

Fili: **"Fresh raspberries? Just picked them this morning."**

Asoka still shows no reaction. Fili's smile drops and he looks down. 

Fili: **"I have a child about your age...I can't imagine them going through what you've gone through...It's ok to feel pain, but please, you must eat. It would dishonour your entire Haven if you were to starve yourself to death."**

Asoka finally looks at Fili. After a moment, Asoka reaches for a raspberry. Fili smiles encouragingly. 

### Page 11

A scratch at the door. Eireena enters with Serena. Fili stands and bows. Asoka also stands, abruptly remembering their manners, and knocks over the raspberries. Asoka looks mortified. 

Asoka: **"Oh no! I'm so sorry!"**

Asoka rushes to pick up the scattered raspberries. Eireena holds up a hand to stop Asoka and smiles wryly as Serena calmly gathers the rest of the raspberries, which mostly scattered in her direction anyway. 

Eireena: **"Please, eat those, and sit."**

Serena returns the raspberries to their bowl, and they all sit, Asoka on their bed futon and obediently shoving a raspberry into their mouth, the others on sitting cushions. 

Eireena: **"Asoka, I want to tell you why the Peacekeepers visited us last night. Is this something you think you can hear right now?"**

Asoka looks at Eireena, suddenly scared. The raspberries in Asoka's hand have been crushed by their sudden tension.

Eireena: **"If you hear what I have to say, and all you want is to hide some place safe for the rest of your life, I guarantee that you will have that place with us. Do you understand?"**

Asoka nods: **"Yes"**

### Page 12

Eireena: **"Good. Last night, Lieutenant Colonel Santiago Garcia of the World Government Peacekeepers told our Haven Council that he has received multiple reports of the Green Havens being attacked by large wolf-like creatures."**

A panel of flashback: the salivating fangs, the terribly cold eyes, a sense of impossibly fast movement for something so large. 

Eireena: **"The Colonel claims that although they can track these creatures, the creatures move too quickly for the Peacekeepers to hunt them down. Nonetheless, he offered to station a platoon of 40 Peacekeepers at our Green Haven as protection, in case the creatures try to attack us."**

Eireena lets her cynicism creep onto her face. 

Eireena: **"I can't say that we can trust their motives at all, but we have little choice...your story confirms the terrifying results of having no protection against these 'Death Dogs'. So we will have Peacekeepers at our Green Haven, and soon, I fear that no Green Haven will be without World Government military presence. I don't think I need to say how much this will compromise our dedication to anonymity and a life free from surveillance."**

Eireena now looks hard at Asoka. 

Eireena: **"If you take your sanctuary with us, this is the life we forsee having to accept. However...if you feel able to travel a more dangerous and risky, but potentially more rewarding path...there is another option."**

Asoka: *"Iri, can you hear me?"*

Iri: *"Yup! Loud and clear!"*

Asoka: *"Shhhhh, you're not supposed to *actually* vocalize!"*

Iri: *"Mmmoopssies!!"*

Asoka and Iri are 

Asoka travels to the southern side of the "Red Zone" (wide stretch of equatorial zone circling the Earth, where it is too hot for even the Biononymous to cross; this zone harshly separates the Northern and Southern hemispheres) as a stowaway on a World Gov Peacekeeper naval vessel. During the journey, Asoka has flashbacks to hearing Eireena's plan - to send Asoka with the Peacekeepers so that they can try to find the mysterious people in the Amazon, warn them of the Peacekeepers' arrival and their questionable motives, and offer these people an alliance with the Biononymous against the World Government. Eireena gifts Asoka with the fruits of a secret Biononymous eSyrup textile research program, which, turns out, Asoka's parents were involved in - eSyrup cloth that can change color and texture to blend into the surroundings perfectly and seamlessly. Asoka is to train the art of controlling this new kind of eSyrup cloth with the help of their mechapet Iri. Eireena then arranged to get Asoka onto the Peacekeeper naval vessel. During the journey, Iri swims in a real ocean for the first time. The Peacekeeper naval vessel finally arrives at the abandoned ruins of the ancient city of Manaus and docks. 

## Chapter 5

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Minka Oosou

Asoka rushed ahead of the Peacekeepers to the location that the World Government designated as the best spot to search for the mysterious Amazonian people, arriving much faster than the loud, noisy, bulky, slow-moving military troops. From that location, Asoka has been searching in an ever growing spiral, with no success. Just as Asoka is about to pass out from hunger and heatstroke, Iri discovers a cave with a false wall, behind which is a garden, clearly cultivated by *someone*. Asoka and Iri find an opening into the secret garden, which provides Asoka with food, water, and respite from the heat. Asoka is so grateful to be alive that they are completely caught unawares by Min, who doesn't recognise the Biononymous clothing and thinks that a ghost or evil spirit is raiding her garden. Min engages the stranger in combat, and knocks off Asoka's head veil. After realising that the evil spirit is actually a human, Min listens to Asoka as Asoka tells Min about the World Gov Peacekeepers. After Asoka has recovered enough to venture back out into the heat, Asoka shows Min the Peacekeepers as they noisily set up base camp and plow through the forest with no regard for the flora and fauna they are destroying. Furious, Min agrees to present Asoka to the Elders of her clan, the Automata. 

## Dream 2: Another Tree Surfer is Born

The Rite of the Mothers, the ceremony that marks the passing from childhood to adulthood within the Automata Clan. 

### Page 1

Bonfires on a warm night. Shadows of well-choreographed ritual dancers, powerful and strong from a lifetime of training, hover warmly, protectively. The view is zoomed out so that we see Min from above. Min is topless, sitting inside a large, fat metal hoop, a la Cyr Wheel. She is surrounded in many concentric circles of family and friends, all dressed in their most splendid clothing made of cloth infused with one of the AUTOMATA's original, surviving eSyrup cultures, called "Mothers". Everyone in the concentric circles are holding hands and focused on Min, their bodies convulsing in synchronised group ritual dance. 

Drum beats keep everyone synchronised.

**"Another Tree Surfer is born tonight."**

Over this backdrop, small close-up panels are scattered, showing different parts of 16 year old Min, large swaths of skin covered in proudly displayed, ecstatically dancing clan tatoos:   
* an eye, nose, and ear. The eye is determined, steely, and dilated with adrenaline and euphoria. The nose and ear are pierced with eSyrup metal, formed into plain, elegantly raw shapes with rounded edges. The brow is set and only slightly sweaty. The head is shaved and covered in tatoos of her achievements as a clan member and Arborist. 
* a strong and straight back, dominated by an eSyrup tatoo depicting a shallow coral ocean scene, ever-changing.  
* shoulder and neck from the front, collar bone straight in a relaxed line that is perfectly parallel to the bottom edge of the panel. Neck is a bit clenched, and tendrils of Min's back tatoo curl around from her back in comforting, fractal patterns.  
* legs, covered in line art encoding her family lineage, are folded in an easy lotus, covered in the soft folds of ritual clothing appropriate for the ascent of a Journeyhume Arborist to the status of Expert Crafter: Tree Surfer. 

**"To be reborn, each Expert Crafter of the Automata must first retreat to one of the sacred caves and refrain from both speech and food for 7 days. Then, they must accept an injection of *raw eSyrup*."**

**"The raw eSyrup is engineered to look for radioactive proteins that mark the cells that were part of the [ectoderm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectoderm), the outer layer of the human embryo. Every Automata, being born in the Red Zone, has lifelong tags on the cells of their skin, hair, nails, eyes, teeth, sinuses, and nervous system."**

### Page 2

3 panels show close-up views of the people in the inner most circle, just on the outside of the metal hoop:  

* Jina, also covered in clan tatoos and splendid eSyrup ritual clothing. Jina's subdermal shield is visible in shadowy patterns under her clan tatoos. Next to her is a tall bucket holding ritual clensing water.  
* Amadou, no subdermal shield and just a few clan tatoos, but dressed spledidly and unspeakably proud of his daughter.   
* Majhee, matriarch leader of their clan, subdermal shield barely visible beneath the many clan tatoos. She is proud, stern, and exhuberant on this day of achievement by her granddaughter.  
* Maraba, Min's cousin and dearest childhood companion, now an Expert Inker and chosen for the honour of injecting Min's subdermal shield. Next to Maraba, in a shallow curving woven basket, is an enormous syringe full of swirling, bubbling, raw eSyrup, freshly harvested from one of their original, surviving cultures, called "Mothers". 

**"DOOOOHM!"** 

The drums all come to a halt, and all of the concentric circles except the innermost lean in sharply on that last booming beat, hands all stretched towards Min, fingers shaking. 

Jina, Majhee, Amadou, and Maraba stand up and pick up the metal hoop. They hold it in place as Min steps onto the curving metal, hands pushing against the hoop above her head. Then they strap Min's ankles and wrists to the metal hoop. 

### Page 3

Maraba picks up the syringe as Jina picks up the bucket of water, leaving Majhee and Amadou to hold the hoop with Min inside steady. 

Jina pours the bucket of water slowly over Min until Min is drenched, then returns the bucket to its precies, previous location in the circle. Then Maraba positions the needle of the syringe full of raw eSyrup against Min's right buttcheek, breaks the skin, and slowly injects all of the eSyrup as Min grits her teeth. 

Min's cousin pulls out the syringe and places it back on the basket. Then Jina, Amadou, Majhee, and Maraba turn Min in slow circles as the raw eSyrup spreads throughout her body, spreading up her torso, across her arms and legs, over her face, and into her eyelids. As the subdermal shield continues into her mouth, nose, and sinuses, Min begins to cough and gag. 

### Page 4

Min's body convulses as her inner circle sets her upright in the very center again. 

The crowd chants **"Be Free! Be FREE! BE FREE!"** as Min finishes integrating the subdermal shield. 

After a tense moment, Min focuses her subdermal awareness to sprout razor sharp spikes at her wrists and ankles, cutting her bonds. The crowd roars with triumph. 

## Chapter 6

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Majhee Suh, Beatriz Cavalcanti, Breno Leite, Nova Jatobá, Jina Suh Barbosa, Amadou Touré 

Asoka tells the Elders of the Automata everything that the Biononymous know about the World Government and present the Biononymous' offer for alliance. The Elders debate the offer, and in the end decide to reject the alliance and move deeper into the Amazon, in the hopes that the Automata can avoid confrontation with the World Government indefinitely. The Elders offer to help Asoka return to the other side of the Red Zone, so that they can relay the Automata's response in person and return home. Asoka confesses that they are able to remotely broadcast the response to the other Biononymous, and besides, they had no more home to go back to. The Elders then offer Asoka asylum with the Automata and invite Asoka to come with them, in exchange for answering the questions of the Elders about the Biononymous and their technology. Fearful of the potential of betraying their dead parents, Asoka hesitates. Having few other options, Asoka accepts asylum with the Automata but asks for time to process before talking about their dead parents' and their research. Asoka uses Iri to relay the news back to Eireena - that the Automata have chosen to decline the offer of alliance, and have decided to go deeper into hiding. Eireena tells Asoka that more Peacekeepers have been stationed at every Green Haven, and that the World Government is now demanding 50% of the Green Havens' yearly yield, supposedly to feed the Peacekeepers who are keeping the Green Havens safe from the Death Dogs. Eireena shares her belief that the Death Dogs are creations of the World Government, meant to create an atmosphere of terror so that the World Government can subdue the planetside population into fearful obedience. Upon hearing this news, Asoka falls into a deep, dark depression. 

## Chapter 7

Character designs: Asoka Morei, Iri, Minka Oosou, Jina Suh Barbosa, Amadou Touré

Min goes to see Asoka and tries to stir Asoka out of their depression by telling Asoka that moping only dishonours the deaths of their Green Haven. Asoka lashes out - how could Min possibly understand how they feel? Min responds by telling Asoka the story of her parents, and how her father Amadou, who was born in an Underground City ruled by a terrible tyrant, lost his parents and nearly everyone he knew and loved in the effort to overthrow the tyrant. Amadou once dreamed of becoming a space explorer, but is now a wanted criminal with a bounty on his head because he killed the tyrant ruler of his home city, so there is no way he can leave the safety of asylum with the Automata. Min tells Asoka of her dream to become a space explorer in her father's stead, by applying to the International Space Exploration Corps via the Space Asylum Program, and encourages Asoka to do the same, reasoning that if Asoka wants to help the Biononymous fight the World Government, they don't need this alliance with the Automata - much more useful would be to go into orbit and learn more about the Orbiters, the principle actors in the World Government. Convinced, Asoka vows to get to the ISE Corps no matter what it takes.
