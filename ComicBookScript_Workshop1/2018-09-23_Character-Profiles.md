# Character profiles

## Majhee Suh 

Born in 2035. Korean who immigrated to Brazil. 

## Minka Oosou

Earther, member of the Automata Clan (South America). To apply to the ISE Corps, disguises herself as a member of the **NAME OF EARTHER GANG**. Fiercely loyal, loudly opinionated, and stubbornly principled. Argumentative and very blunt, but very charismatic and able to stir passionate responses in others. Cares deeply for Asoka.

Pronouns: She/her/hers

Phenotype: East Asian/West African. Thick dark brown hair, slightly curled. Dark brown, almost black, almond-shaped eyes; round moon-shaped face; small button nose. Dark brown skin with mild sun scarring. Petite, a bit shorter than average for an Automota Earther.  Wiry yet physically powerful from a lifetime of capoeira and tree climbing.  

### What does this character want?

Min believes that being free also means that the Automata should be able to move on and off planet as they choose. She resents her grandmother for banishing Soka and for being so afraid of the Orbiters. Min is tired of hiding in the jungle and wants to show the Orbiters how strong Earthers can be. Min dreams of exploring the universe with her own space vessel and crew. 

## Asoka Morei

Earther, member of the Biononymous cult. Introverted, very warm and kind and polite to everyone. Has an extremely calm and gentle disposition, is slow to anger, and loves watching the slow, huge patterns of nature. Always wants to make everyone happy, and sometimes forgets to make themselves happy. Very caring and nurturing. Cares deeply for Min.

Pronouns: They/them/theirs (all Biononymous use gender-neutral pronouns) 

Phenotype: Northern British Isles/Brazilian. Freckles on light olive skin. Reddish-blonde hair. Long aquiline nose, large golden eyes. Very tall, taller than most Earthers. Long-limbs, delicate shoulders. Strong from a life of farming but not very muscled. 

### What does this character want?

Soka dreams of building organic, living, breathing space vessels. They love farming and the Green Havens. The loss of their mother at such a young age is a source of deep sadness. They are frustrated by the World Gov control of the Green Havens and the distribution of the food grown at the Green Havens, but they empathize with the challenges of governance. As Soka grows older they become more and more troubled and preoccupied by the food production and distribution structure, especially the impact of this structure on the quality of food and nutrition education available to Earthers. At the ISE Corps, Soka realises that even Orbiters suffer from the same, and she becomes passionate about food justice.  

## Rhee 

Orbiter, member of the Seppellitori guild (guild of morticians and provider of death/burial rites). Fascinated by the macabre. Extremely meticulous and obsessed with good sanitary practices. Exacting and pragmatic, sometimes to the point of coldness. Incredibly sharp-witted and observant. 

Pronouns: She/her/hers

Phenotype: Mediterranean. Long, straight, hair that she keeps coloured purple. Light olive skin. Extremely petite, even smaller than Min. Large dark-green eyes and a slightly upturned nose. 

### What does this character want?

Rhee is tired of burying Earthers who come to Orbit for jobs with terrible conditions. She wants to do anything that isn't being a mortician, and she wants to have nothing to do with hiring Earthers to do the "dirty work." Rhee feels a great deal of guilt for being an Orbiter, having a social status that makes it easy for her to use Earthers for her convenience, and contributing to a social system that encourages the cruel treatment of the lower classes by the upper classes, the prejudice of Orbiters against Earthers, and the resentment of Earthers against Orbiters. 

## Rajue

Earther, member of the **CENTRAL AMERICAN** gang. Has a fierce temper and can fly into violent rages, especially when provoked by Orbiters. He was born to parents conscripted to work on the **RED ZONE TUNNELS** as essentially indentured slaves, digging in horrible conditions deep underground to connect the Underground Cities, often without proper protection from the toxic effects of air and soil closer to the surface. 

Pronouns: He/him/his

Phenotype: Columbian. Shorter than average for an Earther male. Compact body, well-muscled, with delicate facial features. Light coffee coloured skin, steely dark grey eyes surrounded by long dark lashes. 

### What does this character want?

Rajue wants to get educated and rich as fast as possible, so that he never has to dig another tunnel ever again. He hates the World Gov with a fierce rage and deep smoldering resentment. He wants to leave behind all of the painful memories of now-dead loved ones and get as far away from planet Earth as possible. 

## Tross

Earther, member of the Automata Clan (Eurasia) and disguised as a member of the **METAL WORKERS OF BLACK SEA AREA** gang. Has a knack for metal working and extremely fond of animals, especially cats. Gentle giant who looks large and intimidating but is actually incredibly averse to violence. 

Pronouns: He/him/his

Phenotype: Romanian/Dacia, with Turkish and Indian influences. Wide nose, large ears, hazel-green eyes with flecks of gold, unruly dirty blonde hair that sticks out in all directions. Full facial hair that he often forgets to trim or keep tidy. Large yet dextrous hands, skin the colour of tea-stained parchment paper, pock-marked with scars and stained with soot. Slim hips, broad shoulders, powerfully-muscled arms and legs. 

### What does this character want?

Tross wants to find his mother, a Space Swimmer who fell in love with a construction welder on Earth while visiting the Underground City Optymistychna. Tross's mother left Earth to return to her career as a Space Swimmer when Tross was 3 years old, leaving Tross's father to raise Tross alone.
