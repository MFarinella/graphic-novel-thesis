# Key technologies in The First VIRS

## eSyrup

eSyrup was first synthesized in the 2050s by researchers trying to directly interface silicon circuits with biological tissue. These researchers manage to create a yeast mutant that, when cultured with lactic acid bacteria and fed water and sand, decomposes the silicon dioxide found in most sand. The resulting culture can be vaporized, heat-treated, or "voltage-treated" to induce the atoms within this self-replicating culture to self-assemble into tissue-like sections, which can mimic the behaviour of any component of a classical electronic circuit. However, eSyrup structures do not have to be powered by electricity, and it is later discovered that eSyrup can use ATP for power.  

#### eSyrup "doping"

By using a chemical vapour deposition method derived from [metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalorganic_vapour-phase_epitaxy), various inorganic materials, such as metals, ceramics, glass, and plastic can be "doped" with vaporized eSyrup, in order to give them flexible electronic properties. The exact nature of this flexibility depends on the state of the eSyrup used in the doping process. Certain vaporization techniques allow for the resulting eSyrup product to continue to be independently reconfigurable almost indefinitely (called "flexible eSyrup" or "flex-eSyrup"), while other vaporization techniques destroy its ability to reconfigure (called "fixed eSyrup").

#### eSyrup "splicing"

eSyrup can also be "spliced" with organic materials, such as textiles (wool, cotton, hemp, flax) and paper. Similar to inorganic materials "doped" with eSyrup, organic materials "spliced" with eSyrup can be heat-/voltage-treated to be either "flexible" or "fixed". In general, reconfiguring spliced eSyrup is easier than reconfiguring doped eSyrup. 

eSyrup was spliced with living cells for the first time just before the Global Water Crisis. In 2076, a research group led by Dr. Majhee Suh published a protocol for growing biofilms using raw eSyrup and [*Anabaena*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaena), a genus of cyanobacteria. It is rumoured that this same team also discovered a method for splicing eSyrup with eukaryotic cells, but all records of this research were lost during the Global Water Crisis.
