## Dream 1: Nostalgia

### Page 1

"A long time ago..."

"before the Orbiters lived in the sky,"

"before we hid underground to survive **THE BURNING OCEANS** and The Severing,"

"we all lived together, on the Earth's surface."

"We could all breathe the air,"

"drink the water,"

"feel the sun."

"We were all... 

"FREE."

## Chapter 1: Calm Before the Storm

### Page 1

**"March 16, 2076: São Paulo, Brazil"**

**"It was a day of hope and wonder."** 

**"The Space Consortium had just announced the completion of their third space farm, **THE UPPER ESTATES SPACE ARBORETUM**. The news feeds were drowning in photos of the ribbon-cutting event up in orbit, of beautiful, important people draped in gorgeously fashionable and unspeakably expensive formal attire, eSyrup fabric programmed to fluidly morph in response to the lights, the music, their wearers' moods..."**

**"...of delicate, mouth-watering hors d'oeuvres made from the succulent crops grown and cultivated at the two older space farms, with their carefully filtered water and pristine soil..."**

**"...of the fleet of orbiting home pods that synchronised their velocities with the new arboretum in order to snag front row seats to this historic moment, when humanity proved its ingenuity once more..."**

**"...for the world was becoming too dirty, too extreme in its weather, to support industrial planetside farming..."**

**"...and many people, on this historic day of hope and wonder, were starving..."**

Under this narration, we see a young Majhee walking briskly through the crowded streets of São Paulo. Everyone is wearing what looks like light-weight full-body hazmat suits, flickering a bit as the eSyrup in the material absorbs dangerous radiation in the air, hoods up, breathing masks and googles on. The air is hazy with smog, the sky a smeared grey-blue, the mid-morning sun pale. As Majhee passes shops and cafes, the daily news appears in hologram-like projections that occupy the ceilings or hover at standing-head-height. Other humans have tiny projections coming from subdermally implanted chips in their wrists, palms, ears, or foreheads; these projections surround their wrists, palms, ears, or face with a sphere of light, either sonifying or visualising entertainment, memories, mental models, dreams, news, scholarly publications. 

A lot of the news is about the new space arboretum, but most of the individual info-spheres are focused on news about planetside climate disasters: 
* The Colorado River has dried up completely and the severe drought is causing mass migrations to east, causing massive overcrowding in major inland ("mid-western") cities. 
* Last year's total evaporation of the River Niger has heightened ethnic tensions in the area and armed conflict is escalating.
* An extremely aggressive water-borne disease wipes out several major urban areas in China and India 
* Illnesses from sun radiation, such as skin cancer, have a thousand-fold jump in rate of diagnosis around the world.

### Page 2

We see Majhee walk past a large research facility, metal and glass architecture dully gleaming in the smoggy light, labeled "Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública". The front of the research facility is teeming with protesters, who hold signs and wave flags with slogans like "Não sirva aos tiranos em órbita!", "Educar crianças humanas, não máquinas corporativas!", and "Alimentar humanos não foguetes!"

Majhee sneaks into an alleyway to enter the research facility via a back door. We see a receptionist sitting behind a sealed glass window. Next to him is a decontamination chamber that all must pass thru in order to enter the research facility. 

**Receptionist: "Dr. Suh! How bad is it out there?"**

Majhee takes off her hood and googles and we see her face - pretty and youthful for her 41 years, if it weren't for the lines of worry and grim determination. She shakes out her hair, cropped short in a bowl pixie cut. Clearly burdened with many troubles, she begins taking off her eSyrup hazmat suit.  

**Majhee: "Still crowded."**

**Receptionist: "Idiots. Don't they understand we're trying to help?"**

**Majhee: "Well, they're hungry. Can't think when you're hungry."**

Majhee removes her boots and steps into the decontamination chamber.

### Page 3

Majhee stands in her office, seemingly floating in the center of a giant transparent bacteria made of light. The light model of the bacteria is exquisitely detailed, and a section of the nucleoid is blown up for closer inspection. Majhee's fingers are raised in a well-practiced yet complicated gesture. Her face is darkened with barely contained rage. 

**Off panel: "Majhee, you can't *scoop* the *Space Consortium*..."**

**Majhee: "For the last time, Marcia, it's not scooping if I'm making everything freely accessible!"**

We see Marcia Netto, President of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública, in Majhee's doorway, rubbing her forehead with exasperation.

**Marcia: "You know what I mean. They are *determined* to make money off eSyrup applications, and when you post your lab's developments online under a Creative Commons license, you make that application of eSyrup tech *unpatentable*."**

**Majhee: "Exactly."**

**Marcia: "But you saw what they did with after our collaboration to develop eSyrup fuel! This institute cannot afford another round of legal action like that!"**

### Page 4

Majhee angrily turns off the giant bacteria of light with an impatient gesture as she turns to Marcia, furious.

**Majhee: "*You* pushed that collaboration through, against my numerous objections!"** 

Marcia, immediately apologetic, hands up to ward off Majhee's anger

**Marcia: "I know, I *know*, that was definitely my mistake, and I'm *sorry*."**

**Majhee interrupts: "And stop talking like you actually *believe* in propriatary health research! How is it possible that *anyone* can still hold such *archaic* views?"**

**Marcia, defeated: "*sigh*. Just...be careful."** 

Marcia looks over her shoulder, then turns back to Majhee.

**Marcia, low and careful: "There are rumors that the Space Consortium is trying to *weaponize* eSyrup. I know I sound like a conspiracy theorist, but..."**

**Majhee, incredulous: "They wouldn't dare--"**

Felix, a scientist in Majhee's lab, appears at the doorway, breathless and distraught.

**Felix: "Majhee, my father-- President Netto!"**

**Majhee: "I'm sorry Marcia, we'll have to continue this another time."**

### Page 5

Majhee, Felix, and other members of Majhee's research group sit in a meeting room in an upper floor of the research institute. One wall is a floor-to-ceiling window, showing the dusty sky-line of São Paulo. The sun sits in a reddish hazy sky, just past the midday zenith. 

**Majhee: "So. Your father has been diagnosed again."**

The circle of researchers: **Felix Nicolau**, a pale but handsome man in his late 20s, born and raised in São Paulo by Romanian immigrants, his face lined with fear and sadness even as he sits tall in his seat; **Kai Oliveira**, a much older woman of Japanese-Portuguese descent, grey-haired and hook-nosed, stern-faced and sitting stiffly in her chair; **Beatriz Cavalcanti**, a tall woman in her 30s, a Brazilian of Italian descent, mouth set in a grim line even as her hands squeeze Felix's shoulders in a motherly, comforting gesture; **Nova Jatobá**, a young graduate student in her mid-20s, descended from indiginous Brazilians from deeper inland, her plump face lined with exhaustion; **Vec Barbosa**, a large, portly man of West African descent in his 40s, hands resignedly folded over a substantial beer belly, face kind and sad behind a rather bushy yet neatly-trimmed beard. 

**Vec, to Felix: "Beatriz and I have already contacted your father's medical team, and we've given them access to our database on repeat skin cancer patients. This will greatly improve his chances of recovery, but..."**

**Beatriz, kindly: "We also remember that your father had a liver transplant last year. If you want to go home to be with your family, everyone will understand."**

Felix covers his face with his hands, furious at the tears that won't stop streaming down his face

**Felix: "Skin cancer is still one of the most treatable cancers, even after a second diagnosis. We don't want to move the whole family back to Europe just yet, but...that time may come..."**

Felix now looks up, straight at Majhee, eyes full of determination behind the tears.

**Felix: "I want to finish the biofilm project, *before* Space Consortium can get their filthy hands on another patent. We're *so* close..."**

**Nova: "I'm sure we could manage without you--"**

Kai, arms folded, looking down at her lap with hard eyes.

**Kai: "We can't finish this project in time without Felix. We all know that splicing is more art than algorithm, and ever since my hands starting hurting too much, Felix is our *best*."**

Kai looks over at Nova.

**Kai: "And you've already been pushing yourself to the limit. I know you've been sleeping under your desk for the last week."** 

Nova bursts into tears, and Kai's face falls, looking terribly apologetic but unwilling to admit it. 

### Page 6

We see the circle of researchers sitting in silence, everyone unable to break the silence, everyone contemplating the difficulties of the current situation. 

**Majhee: "I won't..."**

**Majhee: "I can't...*ask* anyone to stay. We all know the risks that come with working on this project, with working in this city right now. We all have family to protect."**

**Majhee: "But I also...personally...can't give up now. A stable splice with a bacterial colony is the first step towards splicing eSyrup with human cells. If Space Consortium patents living splices, they'll have a monopoly on all medical applications of eSyrup, and many will suffer because they can't pay Space Consortium's price."**

**Majhee: "So let me be clear. You are all free to do as you wish. If you choose to leave, I will make sure you can live comfortably for at least the next year."**

**Majhee: "If you stay...I will protect you and your families in any way that I can. And I will forever owe you a debt of gratitude."**

### Page 7

**"September 21, 2076: Massachusetts, USA"**

We see rolling countryside, vibrant with autumn colors, behind a low row of concrete warehouses, labeled "Morei Textiles". 

**Off-panel, secretary: "Iúna, the folks from the World Health Organization are here."**

**Off-panel, Iúna: "Thanks, I'll be with them in a moment."**

We see the inside of a warehouse, where long rows of industrial looms weave eSyrup textiles. Their combined activity generates a gently deafening **"WHIRRRRR"**. Iúna Morei, a tall shapely American woman of Portuguese descent in her early 30s, lustrous wavy brown hair pulled up into a bun, an infant with thick black hair strapped to her front, walks briskly and confidently away from a door labeled "Quiet Room" towards a group of humans waiting near the main entrance of the warehouse. 

Iúna smiles and yells as she waves towards her office door, just next to the entrance to the warehouse and labeled "Iúna Morei, CEO of Morei Textiles".

**Iúna: "HELLO! SHALL WE STEP INTO MY OFFICE?"**

### Page 8

**Iúna: "Thank you for bringing the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols from São Paulo."**

**Dr. Kauffmann: "You know, you'd get these updates a lot faster if you'd just get an info-sphere mod..."**

**Iúna: "Dr. Kauffmann, I'm sure your colleagues can tell you how adamantly opposed I am to body modifications and eSyrup implants. I'm extremely grateful that you've taken the time to travel all the way from DC today."**

**Dr. Kauffmann: "Well, we were in Boston for an emergency conference, so it wasn't too much trouble. Besides, no one can beat your MERV filter efficiency ratings, not with sheer fabrics at least. I've got your organzas in every window of my house."**

**Iúna: "Just doing what we can. What was the emergency conference about?"**

**Dr. Kauffmann: "They're preparing themselves for a huge wave of refugees."**

**Iúna: "Really? From where?"**

Under this dialogue is a view of Iúna's desk. We see sneak peek's of the new splicing and voltage-treatment protocols visualized with light, a floating sphere controlled by a thick piece of eSyrup canvas, stretched on a semi-circular frame that, when Iúna stands inside of it, places the canvas at about hip height, easy to reach while standing. Either one large image or many very close-up views. 

### Page 9

**Dr. Kauffmann: "Didn't you hear? A police raid in L.A. this morning started a huge fire that's spread halfway up the coast of California. It's so big it's getting blown over the mountains into Arizona by high winds. Everything out there is bone dry ever since the Colorado River disappeared."**

**Iúna: "What?? How many dead??"**

**Dr. Kauffmann: "Unfortunately we haven't had a chance to count yet. Thousands are already homeless."**

**Iúna: "How does a police raid start a state-wide fire??"**

**Dr. Kauffmann: "It's all the plastic furniture - they're basically *solid* petroleum, turns a misplaced candle into a fireball in just *minutes*. And LA to San Francisco is so packed with cheap cookie-cutter homes, in retrospect, I'm amazed this didn't happen sooner. I'm sorry, I should have realised you wouldn't have heard yet...do you know anyone over there?"**

**Iúna: "Yes, I...I'm sorry I need to make a call..."**

**Dr. Kauffmann: "Of course. I'll see myself out."**

Under this dialogue we see close-up views of the baby strapped to Iúna's front. The child is a little less than one year old. The strapping is an intricately folded piece of eSyrup cloth that can amplify the baby's heartrate, breathing, and digestive sounds. 

### Page 10

*Iúna: "Tahoe, have you been able to contact Joshua Tree?"*

Iúna is outside, and her baby is no longer strapped to her chest. Instead, her face is covered in a thick veil and she wears what looks like a heavy, full-sleeved and full-length apron. eSyrup circuits flash within the weave of both Iúna's veil and apron. She stands, facing west, arms flung out wide, back straight and tall, legs apart, boots planted wide in the frosty grass. 

*Iúna's Biononymous contact at Green Haven Tahoe: "Negative, Mama Bird."*

*Iúna: "How is Tahoe?"*

*Tahoe: "Fire hasn't gotten further than Fresno, but we're getting ready to offer sanctuary."*

*Iúna: "So...it *was* the body mod."*

*Tahoe: "Looks like it. They didn't even bother going for the decoy."*

### Page 11

Iúna ponders for a moment, her face furrowed with grief and concentration.

*Iúna: "Tahoe, I've changed my mind. I vote for registering as a religion."*

*Tahoe: "Wa-wait, seriously?"*

*Iúna: "Yes. We need all of the protections we can get right now."*

*Tahoe: "You've been thinking about what Pigsah said at our last TeleSensing?"*

*Iúna: "Yes. They were right - it's relatively easy right now to live without body mods. But once all the schools require every student to get an info-sphere mod, once every industry requires employees to use body mods in order to be qualified for the job...our children **won't** have a choice. They'll have to list their body mods on their CV, you just won't be a qualified human **adult** if you don't have a body mod."*

*Tahoe: "But...declaring ourselves a religion...it just feels like we're setting ourselves up for all the pitfalls of a **cult**."*

*Iúna: "I know, and that's why I intially voted against it. But if we want defend our right to live without constant surveillance, we can't just empower individual decisions without thinking about how to co-exist with the rest of society. If we don't take drastic measures, in just 10 years our social structures will make it **impossible** to live without constant surveillance."*

### Page 12

*Tahoe: "But we still haven't figured out our own solutions to the really **practical** advantages of body mods...long-distance communication, ways to aid our memories and gain perspective on our behaviour..."*

*Iúna: "That's why I've changed my mind. Our eSyrup research needs to expand, and it needs to stay under the radar. Tahoe, you know what that research group in Brazil published last month?"*

*Tahoe: "What?"*

*Iúna: "The first successful splice of eSyrup with a living organic compound, a recipe for creating eSyrup **biofilm**!"*

*Tahoe: "...Sorry Mama Bird, I don't follow eSyrup research like you do. Why should I care about biofilm?"*

*Iúna: "Because that's the **beginning**. Those bastards managed it before Space Consortium, got it published before Space Consortium could patent it. Do you remember how we once talked of synthetic companion creatures, that can act like portable, non-invasive info-spheres?"*

*Tahoe: "...yes...?"*

*Iúna: "**It's possible now.** If they can splice eSyrup with a microcolony of bacteria, then we can figure out how to splice eSyrup into bigger, more complex living things. And if creating and interacting with these creatures is part of our religious practice..."*

*Iúna: "...then we have much stronger grounds to deny oversight by Space Consortium, or any national government!"*

## Chapter 2: Where Thunder Goes When It Dies

### Page 1

**"September 23, 2077: Ushuaia, Argentina"**

We see a bustling harbour town, everything about it small and cute except for the occassional warehouse factory or modern high rise office building - these were clearly very recent additions to a place that otherwise hadn't changed very much in many hundreds of years.

**"When growing a personal supply of eSyrup, say, for research or for fun, you can feed it enough silica just by running down to the beach once a week with a soup bowl."**

**"Industrialized eSyrup production, however, needs quite a bit of silica."**

**"Sand mining was out of the question, given the Space Consortium's concern with their image - wouldn't want their brand tarnished by news of their operations destroying delicate coastal ecosystems or picturesque beachside communities."**

**"So they turned to the next biggest source of biogenic silica - deep-sea deposits in the Antarctic."**

We see close-ups of the [wildlife at Green Haven Cabo de Hornos](https://youtu.be/06LcgVQg7Yk) with tumultuous ocean and raw, mountainous landscape. Off in the distance, we see a tiny speck on the horizon - a deep-sea silica mining rig. A tiny plume of smoke, looking both innocent and foreboding, curls up from the rig. 

### Page 2

**"Ocean Acidification Monitoring Station, Roca Redonda, Galapagos Islands"**

**Technician: "Dr. Zambrano! Dr. Zambrano!"**

**Dr. Zambrano: "What is it?"**

**Tech: "The pH levels...do you see...!"**

**Dr.Zambrano: "Dios mío...how can it fall so fast??"**

### Page 3

**"Thermohaline Circulation Observation Centre, Orkney Islands"**

This scene should give clues about the deep-sea silica drilling disaster, which suddenly makes the shallow parts of the ocean water column drastically more acidic, combined with a shut down of important ocean current circulations like the Meridional Overturning Circulation - see [this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rising-acidity-in-the-ocean/) and [this article](https://www.wunderground.com/resources/climate/abruptclimate.asp) for more info. 

### Page 4

**"October 12, 2077: São Paulo, Brazil"**

The crowds in front of the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública are gone, and everyone on the street is now wearing a breathing mask. We see Majhee, fully dressed in protective gear and a breathing mask, weave her way through a crowd and rush into the front door of the research institute. 

**Majhee: "We need to finish packing up NOW."**

Meanwhile, in São Paulo, Majhee and her colleagues have just one year ago successfully spliced eSyrup with eukaryotic cell cultures for the first time, and now they are witnessing the birth of the first eSyrup-spliced mammal, a rat-like creature named Nimh. Nimh lives 11 days. Nimh dies on the day that the news of the deep-sea silica harvesting rig disaster reaches the Laboratório Nacional de Biociências e Saúde Pública. 

One month ago, when NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) levels in São Paulo were declared 20 times above the World Health Organisation's most recent recommended thresholds for outdoor air quality, Felix and his family moved back to Romania. 

Majhee and her colleagues pack up all of their raw eSyrup cultures and research and flee with their families inland. They hide with friends and family in caves deep under the Amazon Rainforest. 

Iúna flees with her son João into caves in Vermont to escape the huge clouds of hydrogen flouride.

Amadou and his parents flee to the caves beneath Green Haven Santarém, in the Pará province of Brazil. 

Massive fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation from sun flares completely disrupt digital computing technology infrastructure. The vast majority of servers worldwide are wiped clean. 

Amid the chaos, nearly 60,000 planetside humans swarm onto Space Barges to flee into orbit. The Space Barges are overcrowded and the Space Consortium fears that too many people will try to come up into orbit and overload their resources, so they decide that, after one last trip, the Space Barges would remain docked at the Orbital stations and not return to planetside until planetside has stabilized. 

## Dream: Childhood

### Page 1

We see the enormous trunk of a giant tree in the Amazon Rainforest. A very young Soka, wearing traditional Biononymous clothes, looks up the tree with wonder and awe. 

**Min: "Come ON, Soka!!"**

The beaming face of a very young Min appears from behind one of the dense clusters of leaves. She has already climbed quite high, and looks down at Soka, still on the ground, with unfiltered impatience. 

Soka puts a gloved hand reverently on the tree trunk, and suddenly feeling shy, morphs words into the top of their head covering: "I've...never climbed a tree..."

**Min: "You what?? What do you mean *never*??"**

### Page 2

Without waiting for Soka's response, Min quickly and decisively climbs back down to Soka. 

Min takes Soka's hand gently and beams at Soka with friendly, naive excitement. 

**Min: "It's easy! My nanna says that we used to live in trees all the time. You just hug the tree and it will never let you down!"**

**Min: "Like this..."**

Min guides Soka's arms to wrap around the main tree trunk, climbing onto a low branch in order to the position the much taller Soka correctly. Min then hops down to the ground and croches behind Soka, hands clasped together to create a step for Soka's foot. 

**Min: "Now, one foot's gonna step onto my hands, then the other foot will go on my shoulder. Don't worry, I help Gustavo all the time, and he's much bigger than you."**

Soka hesitantly places a foot into Min's hands. 

**Min: "Ok, on three! One, two--!"**

Min straightens her legs as Soka scrabbles for a branch to hold. 

**Min: "Ok, now other foot on my shoulder!"**

Soka complies, and the two children make a wobbly human tower, the short but sturdy Min basing the taller, more willowy Soka. 

**Min: "Hug the tree, hug the tree!!"**

### Page 3

Min and Soka have made it to the top of the tree and are lying on a platform, staring up at a sky that seems blue, with clouds that seem puffy and far away. Min reaches up with a finger to poke at the eSyrup bubble separating them from the sky, protecting them from the real sun and atmosphere, both too harsh now for humans to lie under unprotected. Soka's gloved fingers also graze the eSyrup bubble. 

**Min: "One day, I'll be a real Tree Surfer, and then I'll be able to see the real sky, and feel real wind!"**

Soka's face mask rearranges to read, "It's not so pretty out there..."

Min lets her fingers intertwine with Soka's. 

**Min: "Can we telesense? I want to keep looking up..."**

Min and Soka let their clasped hands fall above their heads onto the platform as they gaze up. 

*Soka: "Does it still tickle?"*

*Min: "Haha, a little! But I'm used to it now, I think."*

### Page 4

*Soka: "Why do you want to go out there so bad? It's so much nicer inside your bubbles."*

*Min: "Because I **know** this is fake. I want reality, no matter how **ugly** it is."*

Min punches the eSyrup bubble. The location of impact swirls with iridescent colors before settling back into a clean, clear blue. 

*Min: "So you don't have trees at the Green Havens?"*

*Soka: "Not big ones like this. We don't have giant, flexible eSyrup bubbles at the Green Havens, just sealed greenhouses made of eGlass and eSteel. So nothing grows taller than 2 meters."*

*Min: "How can you stretch your brain if all of your ceilings are so low?"* 

*Soka: "Ha, I guess we can't. Honestly, most people are so used to being underground, or indoors, I don't think they notice."*

*Min: "That's crazy..."*

## Chapter 3: 

### Page 1

**"October 5, 2119: A maintenance shaft on the Gemini Youth Station"**

We see a beautiful half dome of transparent material encasing the Gemini Arboretum, glittering with greens and blues against the stark blackness of space. We can barely see four sections to the Arboretum: one section glitters with icy frost, another is gently dewy and full of riotous spring colors, the next simmers with heat and condensation, and the last is a marvel of autumn colors. The arboretum is part of the larger Gemini Youth Station, which includes a mess hall, student accommodations, a full-gravity sphere where students can exercise, and a common area. The entire Gemini Youth Station is attached to the Space University Station by a large steel bridge. Far below, we see the grubby edge of Earth's atmosphere. 

The voices are coming from a section of the Gemini Youth Station just before the bridge leading to Space University Station. 

**Rhee, off-panel: "They're headed towards Space Uni! Min, what if they're a Guild Leader?"**

**Min, off-panel: "Even more reason to make them explain why they're messing with our farm!"**

**"CLANG"**

**Min, off-panel: "Oooowww..."**

**Rhee, off-panel: "Min, you alright??"**

**Min, off-panel: "Yeah...did they go through a wall? This is where the next handprint is."**

### Page 2

We see Minka, tenderly rubbing her head, behind Rhee, whose forehead info-sphere is flashing an incomplete schematic of the Gemini Station maintenance shafts. Rhee's hands, fingers bent in a complex gesture, are also dimly lit with spheres. They are in a dark maintenance shaft above the main corridor leading to the bridge that connects Space University Station with the Gemini. 

**Rhee: "Throw me your eyes?"**

Min closes her eyes, and through her eyelids, we see an x-ray-like version of the maintenance shaft. A ghostly hand print glows on the wall panel in front of Rhee. This view is replicated on Rhee's forehead info-sphere. 

**Rhee: "Hmmmmm..."**

Rhee lines up her hands to the glowing hand prints and gingerly begins to feel around the wall panels. 

**"ba-DOOP"**

**Rhee: "Aha!"**

The wall panel morphs, and now airlock door appears in front of them, glowing a dull, gentle red. 

### Page 3

**Min: "Nice! Can you open it?"**

**Rhee: "Maybe?"**

Rhee has adjusted the light spheres at her hands, which now give her an x-ray-like view of the inner circuitry of the airlock door as she runs her hands over the metal. 

**"bleep!"**

**Rhee: "Interesting...why does a hidden airlock door have an ID scanner? Who else uses this door, besides a bunch of delinquent muskies who are probably ruining their chances of doing well on their qualification exams?"**

**Min: "Do you even have to worry about the quals? I thought you were assigned already?"**

**Rhee: "Assigned, but not Accepted. Didn't you pay any attention to induction?"**

**Min: "Only to the interesting parts..."**

### Page 4

==Flashback==

**"One month ago..."**

We see a bird's eye view of the Gemini Station docking bay. About 150 new students, mostly Orbiters, stream out of the docked shuttle with their luggage, some in small groups of friends, and gather into a crowd facing a raised platform at the opposite end of the docking bay. A long row of about 25 older Orbiter teens, wearing the guild crests that mark them as 3rd year apprentices, stand on the raised platform, looking over the new trainees. Every 3rd or 4th apprentice holds a sign with the name and crest of a guild: 

* Infradestructors
* Mendeleevers
* Cyberphilia
* Hippocrates
* Exocology
* Corpora Caelus
* Univatiso
* Unassigned

But in this scene we don't need to see all of the guild crests in great detail. 

We see Min, Asoka, and Rhee in the crowd of first years. Asoka, easily one of the tallest first years, sticks out above the crowd, while both Min and Rhee struggle to look over the tops of the heads in front of them. 

One of the third years steps forward and spreads their arms wide. The area around their mouth glimmers a bit from the body mod that is amplifying their voice. 

**Third-year apprentice: "HELLO! CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME?"**

Obligatory cheers from the audience. Min whoops and jumps, Rhee tries very hard to look too cool to be excited, and we can see Asoka's grin under layers of face veil. 

**Third-year apprentice: "WELCOME TO THE GEMINI YOUTH STATION, HOME OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE EXPLORATION CORPS!"**

### Page 5

The 3rd year apprentices step forward and spread out along the front of the raised platform. 

**Third-year apprentice: "IF YOU HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED, PLEASE FIND YOUR GUILD REP AND GO WITH THEM FOR YOUR GUILD-SPECIFIC INDUCTION!"**

The "freshies" begin to break apart into groups of about 20. Guild reps lead each group towards a different docking bay door. 

**Rhee: "I'm assigned to Mendeleevers. What about you two?"**

Asoka's clothes morph to say "Exocology".

**Min: "I'm...unassigned?"**

All three look back up at the platform as the 3rd year with the amplified voice gestures to two of the 3rd years.

**Third-year apprentice: "IF YOU ARE UNASSIGNED, PLEASE FOLLOW ZALO AND JHERI!"**

Zalo smiles and gestures freshies towards Jheri, who has now come down from the raised platform and is herding Unassigned freshies towards Docking Bay Door 0813. 

### Page 6

We are now in a small meeting room just inside the hallway of Docking Bay Door 0813. 

**Jheri: "Welcome everyone! I'm Jheri, apprentice of the Hippocrates guild, and this is Zalo, apprentice of the Infradestructors guild. We are your Guild Reps, which, in your case, means we are here to help you get a guild recommendation before qualifying exams at the end of the month!"**

**Zalo: "You don't *need* a recommendation to a guild in order to take their qualifying exam, but it's generally a very good indicator of your chances. You can take up to 3 qualifying exams, and if you *want* a recommendation, you'll need to impress the guild reps."** 

**Jheri: "By passing a guild's qualifying exam, you will have earned a guild assignment. A guild assignment is a mutual pledge of respect and solidarity, and a commitment to study the skills and protect the secrets of your guild."**

**Jheri: "If you do not pass any qualifying exams, there will be no room for you at this school, and you will have to go home."**

**An Earther Gangie named Rajue: "But, wait, what if we're part of the Space Asylum Program? We have no home to go back to!"**

Jheri looks terribly apologetic. 

**Jheri: "If no guild will accept you, your scholarship will be void."**

**A wave of anxious whispers briefly rumbles through the gathered first-years: "But wait, then what about the bursary they promised my family?" "Wasn't last year's drop-out rate something insane, like 40%??" "Why can't we take a drop-out's assignment?" "You mean no one is obligated to teach us, even though we made it this far?" "Your recruitment material is deliberately misleading!"**

**Rajue: "So hold on, who put you in charge?"**

**Close-up on Jheri's eyes as she gives him a sharp look: "No one. We volunteered."**

==End Flashback==

### Page 8

**"Back in the maintenance shaft on Gemini Arboretum..."**

We are back in the maintenance shaft. 

**Rhee: "Don't you have recommendations from, like, every guild?"**

**Min: "Not Corpora Caelus..."**

**Rhee: "You really want them that badly? 6 out of 7 guilds want you, and you want the *one* guild that hasn't offered you a rec. And here I am, struggling for anything at all."**

**Min: "Oh come on! The Mendeleevers have been falling all over themselves to recommend you ever since you learned how to pull medical grade micro-eGlass in just a week. You could take just their exam and not even care about the other 2."**

**Rhee: "Well, thank you for the compliment, but I'm still going to take 3 exams. It would be so embarrassing if I was so arrogant I took just one exam, and then I *didn't* pass...huh, well that's really weird."**

**Min: "What?"**

**Rhee: "The ID register is completely empty."**

**Min: "Seriously?"**

**Rhee: "I guess this means we definitely need to disable it. Otherwise it'll look too suspicious..."**

### Page 9

Asoka suddenly appears next to them, placing a warning hand on both Minka and Rhee's mouths. A cuttlefish mechapet is wrapped around Asoka's neck. Rhee freezes in terror; Min grabs Soka's hand in a combative knee-jerk reaction before controlling herself. 

**Rhee: "Aaaah! Oh jeez, Soka, I'm not used to your camou yet, can't you at least throw us your breath??"**

We see a faint smile behind layers of translucent face veil, as the front of Asoka's traditional Biononymous clothing morphs to create the letters "Maybe I'll get a bell." The cuttlefish mechapet oozes forward to sit on Asoka's shoulder and chirps at Rhee. 

**Cuttlefish Mechapet: "We're silent, like ninjas!"

**Rhee: "Good for you, Iri."**

Even though Rhee tries to act annoyed, she can't help reaching over to pet Iri. 

**Min: "Haha, you found us! Were you able to analyse the plants?"**

The three teens stand in a circle with their hands palm-to-palm. 

*Asoka: "So, yes, I was able to analyse them, but...these plants are **really** weird."*

*Min: "What do you mean?"*

### Page 10

*Asoka: "What I **mean**, is, even though these plants are growing more slowly, and they **look** like runts, their nutrient content is off the charts! Calcium, potassium, zinc, iron, protein, they're all elevated to about 20 percent more than the crops we originally planted."* 

*Rhee: "Wait, are you telling us...that the mystery crops are **better** than the fancy proprietary crops the ISE Corps buys from Space Consortium?"*

Min suddenly grips both Asoka and Rhee's hands tightly. 

*Min: "Oh...my...BUTTS, you know what this **means**??"*

*Rhee: "Min, you're hurting my hand."*

*Min: "Sorry! But do you get it??"*

*Asoka: "I guess this means...that our mystery farmer might actually be on our side...?"*

*Min: "Maybe!"*

### Page 11

*Rhee: "Ok, let's not jump to conclusions yet. Soka, did you screen the plants for eSyrup-tuned genetic structures, or whatever it was you were looking for?"* 

*Asoka: "So, yeah, that's another weird thing...some of the plants **are** genetically modified to form silica-harvesting proteins during digestion, but this was only about 1 out of 10 of the plants I analysed. And the I can't tell what other structures these plants are genetically modified to build, but they have some **really** weird gene sequences."*

*Min: "So...we're back where we started."*

Min disconnects her palms from Rhee and Asoka to rub her temples with mild frustration. 

**Min: "We need to find our mystery farmer, and interrogate them, whoever they are."**

Asoka's clothes morph to read "Yes."

**Rhee: "But we were just talking about how they might be a Guild Leader!"**

### Page 12

**Min: "Rhee, you know where human bodies store silica? *In our bones and cartilage*. In the case of you and every Orbiter on this station, your skeletons are already depleted from a lifetime in orbit. Do you really want to become an immobile *blob*, unable to move your own body, eating these mysterious plants that will *suck your bones out of you*?"**

Rhee looks horrified. 

**Rhee: "*That's* what these plants will do to us??"**

**Min: "I mean, I don't *know* for sure, but if these they're gonna build silica-harvesting proteins in our guts, then I wanna know whose *frakkin* great idea it was to plant these crops on our school farm, and why!"**

Asoka's clothes morph to read "I agree!". 

Rhee looks at Min and Asoka. 

Rhee sighs. 

**Rhee: "How did I *know* that you two would get me into trouble?"**

## Chapter 4

### Page 1

**"October 5, 2119: A maintenance shaft on the Gemini Arboretum"**

Rhee is working on unlocking the secret airlock door, which is still glowing a dull red. Min is practicing her handstands. Asoka and Iri are practicing their camouflage. 

The airlock door suddenly turns green and gently clicks open. 

**Min: "Finally!"**

Min drops her legs to get out of the handstand and comes over to inspect the secret door. Asoka comes over as well, and Asoka and Iri also inspect the door. Rhee steps back and stares hard at the back of Min's head. 

Rhee comes to a decision. 

**Rhee: "We still need to disable the ID register...especially if you want to go through, Min."**

Min looks at Rhee with wary curiosity. 

**Min: "Why's that?"**

Rhee blushes, but plows ahead. 

**Rhee: "You're not a normal Earther gangie, are you?"**

**Rhee: "Who are you really, Aramina Pedroso of the Petar Caves?"**

### Page 2

==Flashback==

**"September 2, 2119: On the shuttle barge service to Gemini Arboretum."**

Backdrop: the glittery blackness of outer space, tempered by the light touch of the outermost layer of atmosphere. 

**PA: "This is a World Government Shuttle Barge Service, departing from Lower Estates Space Arboretum and terminating at Gemini Arboretum. Our next stop is the Mae Jemison Memorial station."**

Small panel, upper left of the page: very close-up view of Min's closed eye. Her subdermal shield is in stealth mode, mostly invisible except where it is pretending to be tendrils of hair cut into an elaborate shaved pattern; her clan tatoos, frozen in an imitation of an Earther gangie's head tatoo. Just around her eye, we see shadows of her raw eSyrup tatoo flickering with hints of her dreams. 

**PA: "You may unbuckle your safety harnesses at this time."**

Another small panel, floating just to the right and a little below the first panel: The eyelid cracks open and we see part of a dark, deep brown eye flecked with gold. A tendril of hair floats across Min's forehead - there is no longer enough gravity to hold it down. 

**PA: "Please exercise caution while moving about the shuttle barge."**

Two panels, the same size as the previous small panels, connected to each other and in the middle of the page: (on the left) Min's POV, looking down her belly at the harness buckle. (on the right) View from above Min's seat, as Min floats up above her seat, still half-asleep and holding her belly rather tenderly. The PA announcement is mirrored in scrolling text in many languages on the ceiling of the shuttle compartment. 

**PA: "If you would like to purchase any drinks or snacks, the cafe compartment is now open."**

### Page 3

We see Min sitting in the cafe compartment, nursing a hot tea and still looking a bit groggy. She stares out the window as the curvature of the Earth slowly rotates under the shuttle. 

**PA: "This is the Mae Jemison Memorial station. Change here for services to the Peggy Whitson Memorial Space Arboretum. The next station is Upper Estates Space Hub. This shuttle terminates at Gemini Station."** 

Min is well-hidden behind her large pack in her corner booth by the viewing port. Crowds of mostly Orbiters have gathered in small groups throughout the cafe compartment. Earthers are scattered throughout the room, clustered in their own cliques. The Earthers all have much bulkier bodies than the Orbiters, and in many cases their backs are hunched and their skin is ghostly pale, thanks to living their lives in underground tunnels. The vast majority of both Earthers and Orbiters are surgically equipped with World Government standard issue eSyrup body modifications, which stretch their skin and cast faint, bruise-like shadows. Some of the Earthers, mostly from military or academia families, also find room to be disdainful and superior towards the Earther gangies, identifiable by their elaborate head tatoos, who tend to be from the lowest castes in the great underground World Government cities. 

There is a commotion by the bar. An Earther gangie teen, with a body covered in mods and cautious, defensive eyes, has knocked over the drink of a petite Orbiter girl and got her drink all over her. 

**Petite Orbiter girl: "Wha--! Well excuse you!"**

**Earther gangie: "What? You were standing in the middle of the path."**

**Petite Orbiter: "What path, we're standing at the bar!"**

During this scene, the panels are focused on Min, who is watching with bored eyes from over her hot cup of tea. 

Behind her, a body dressed in the multi-layered clothing of the Biononymous cult appears. The body places a finger onto Min's back. 

*Biononymous teen: "Min?"*

We can see Min's eyes, reflected in the viewing port, grow wide as the reflection shows a vague figure. Min's mouth curves up into a triumphant grin.

*Min: "You made it!!!"*

### Page 4

Our attention shifts to the fight happening at the bar. Earther gangie reaches over to a not-quite cleared table to grab a mostly unused napkin while simultaneously grabbing Petite Orbiter's hand and starts to mop up the spilled drink on her hand. However, he is quite rough and his facial expression betrays his anger at having to apologize. 

**Earther gangie: "Look, I'm really sorry--"**

Petite Orbiter yanks her hand away coldly. 

**Petite Orbiter: "Don't touch me."** 

**Earther gangie: "What, I'm trying to--"**

**Petite Orbiter: "THAT'S NOT CLEAN, DON'T TOUCH ME WITH IT!!"** 

This moment draws everyone's attention in the cafe.

### Page 5

Some other Orbiters come over and push the Earther gangie away.

**Orbiters: "Hey why don't you leave her alone?" "Just stop!" "Leave, Muskie!"** 

Earther gangie gets immediately wild-eyed and tenses his body into a fighting stance. 

**Earther gangie: "You guys wanna fight?!"**

Some of the other Earther gangie's perk their ears and start to turn towards the scene.  

**Petite Orbiter: "What?? No!"**

### Page 6

Earther gangie presses a small grey canister into a body mod port on his neck, and his legs suddenly puff up, get more defined, his arms also get more buff, and an already sturdy-looking human is now pumped up like a body builder.

**Earther gangie: "Fight me!!"**

With a roar, several other Orbiters and Earther gangies press similar canisters into their necks, suddenly pump up, and throw themselves at each other. 

Everyone else looks on in serene befuddlement, and we see that even Min and the Biononymous teen can't help but stare. 

Petite Orbiter has also pressed a capsule into the mod port at her neck in an attempt to stay safe in a suddenly escalated situation, but her transformation isn't going smoothly. Her body wobbles and inflates in a rather chaotic manner for a few seconds, then everything deflates and the Petite Orbiter heaves an enormous vomit. People around her scatter away as fast as they can, knocking over more drinks. As she stumbles to get away from the fight, she turns and runs into the tall Biononymous teen. Min looks at the Petite Orbiter with concern.

**Min: "Are you alright?"**

Petite Orbiter looks up at Min, pained and desperate, as the Biononymous teen steadies her. Then the Petite Orbiter heaves another vomit. 

### Page 7

The original Earther gangie who knocked Petite Orbiter's drink has finally noticed where Petite Orbiter ended up.

**Earther gangie: "Hey!"** 

Min looks up to see him rushing over, intent on fighting Petite Orbiter. Min tries to warn the Biononymous teen and the Petite Orbiter.

**Min: "Watch out--!"**

But the Earther gangie is blind with chemically-amplified fury and approaching too fast. Min steps in front of Biononymous teen and Petite Orbiter to grab his punching arm and throws his weight over her hip. He crashes into the cafe booth. 

Min stands over the Earther gangie, looking disappointed and a bit angry. 

**Min: "Hey, can't you see she's sick?"** 

In the background, Biononymous teen is completely holding up Petite Orbiter. 

**Earther gangie: "Why do you care?! Whose crew are you on anyway??"** 

Earther gangie runs a wild eye judgmentally over Min as he tries struggles to stand. His upper lip curls in a cruel smirk

**Earther gangie: "A mod virgin??"**

Min's brow furrows at the derogatory term. 

**Earther gangie, off-panel: "No wonder you're useless!"**

### Page 8

Tendril-like arms of a mechapet cuttlefish deftly twist out the grey capsule at Earther **GANGIE**'s neck with a soft *"KWUSSSSSSHHHHH"*. 

**Earther gangie: "What the--!"**

An inky, blobulous cuttlefish mechapet, floating behind the Earther gangie's head, tosses the grey capsule into its mouth with a happy gurgle. 

**Cuttlefish mechapet: "I love Whamo!!"**

Without the chemicals in the capsule, the Earther gangie deflates quickly, and starts to shiver; furiously. 

**Earther gangie: "That's not fair, you *frakkin* robot!"** 

Meanwhile, mecha-cleaners have rushed over and start sucking up Petite Orbiter's vomit. She looks almost ill again, watching the cleaning robots seemingly slurp up her vomit, so Biononymous teen, their traditional religious eSyrup clothing glowing with the "data-shivers" from Iri's consumption of the Whamo capsules, now easily turns Rhee away.

**PA, frantic, as other Orbiters and Earther gangies continue to brawl: "Will passengers please note that physical violence will not be tolerated on this shuttle service! Will passengers please note that physical viole--"**

The PA interrupts itself with a familiar ding.

**PA: "We are now approaching Upper Estates Space Hub. Exit here for the ISE Space Orchestra Conservatory."**

### Page 9

We see Min's hand with Petite Orbiter's capsule, holding it out to the cuttlefish mechapet. 

**Min: "Here, eat this too."**

Mecha-tentacles snag the capsule and bring it back to a delighted cuttlefish mechapet. 

Petite Orbiter, seated, is digging frantically through her bag as Biononymous teen holds the bag for her. 

**Petite Orbiter: "Frak, I have no water..."**

Min cheekily produces 3 hilariously tiny bottles of water.

**Min: "Fizzy water nicked from the cafe?"**

### Page 10

Wide panel: the 3 teens, sitting side-by-side in the shuttle seats. Petite Orbiter sits in the middle, anti-nausea pill packaging crumpled in one hand, head tilted back as she guzzles the fizzy water clenched in her other hand, eyes closed, breathing hard. Min sits with her legs crossed in her seat and looking rather pleased with herself. The Biononymous teen sits with legs folded on top of their seat, cuttlefish mechapet happily munching the rest of Petite Orbiter's capsule as Biononymous teen pats it on the head. Biononymous teen's clothing once again pulse with glowing patterns, betraying a wireless coupling between the mechapet's internal state and the eSyrup in the Biononymous teen's clothing.  

**Petite Orbiter: "Thanks. Taking Whamo was a terrible idea..."**

**Min: "Is that what's in those capsules?"**

Petite Orbiter nods and wipes her face with an eSyrup handkerchief she produces from her left sleeve.

**Petite Orbiter: "Have you never seen anyone using uppers before? I guess you are a mod vir-- sorry, I mean, you don't have an body mods..."** 

Min laughs. 

**Min: "No worries. I'm Aramina Pedroso, from the Petar Caves of South America."**

### Page 11

**Petite Orbiter: "I'm Rhee of the Seppellitori guild, Vela quadrant. Thank you for helping me."** 

Rhee gives Min an innocently curious sidelong glance.

**Rhee: "Which gang are you from? I don't recognize your head tatoo..."**

**Min: "How does an Orbiter know how to recognize Earther gangie head tatoos?"**

Rhee looks sad and guilty and looks down again.

**Rhee: "My parents are morticians for several large space construction companies who work with conscripted Earther gangies...so I've seen lots of head tatoos..."**

### Page 12

The cuttlefish mechapet belches, breaking the awkward silence. Min and Rhee stare, then they both start to laugh. 

Rhee looks at the mechapet with an extended hand.

**Rhee: "My name is Rhee, what's yours?"**

The mechapet eagerly stretches out its arms to Rhee.

**Cuttlefish mechapet: "I'm Iri, I like you!"**

Rhee turns to the Biononymous teen, whose clothing have morphed to spell out "Hi! Would you like to telesense?"

**Rhee: "Oh! Sure, but how...?"**

The Biononymous teen extends a hand palm forward to Rhee, a ghost of a smile visible beneath the teen's face mask. After a moment of confusion, Rhee puts her palm against the Biononymous teen's hand, who presses against Rhee's hand as Rhee suddenly looks as if she's being lightly electrocuted.

**Rhee: "Aaah! ...oh wow, that was weird!"**

Rhee stares at her hand.

Then Rhee looks up at the Biononymous teen with a grin.

**Rhee: "Pleased to meet you, Asoka of Green Haven Hibernia!"** 

Iri claps two of its arms in celebration and looks enormously pleased. 

==End of flashback==

## Chapter 5

### Page 1

**"October 5, 2119: A maintenance shaft on the Gemini Arboretum"**

Iri has two amorphous arms over its mouth in a caricature of horror. Min grins.

**Min: "Did you just now figure that out, or have you been too polite to say anything?"**

**Rhee: "When we started hanging out a lot, I noticed...your head tatoo isn't always the same..."**

Min grimaces and smacks herself in the head. Asoka turns sharply to Min, and the front of their clothes morph to say, "I told you you've been getting sloppy!"

**Min: "Shoot, I need to be more careful..."**

**Rhee: "Anyway, we might all get expelled for snooping around like this, and while I'm not inherently opposed to figuring out what's going on, it's still a huge risk."**

Rhee crosses her arms and looks at Min stubbornly. 

**Rhee: "If you want any more of my help, I need to know who you really are."**

### Page 2

Min heaves a big sigh and sits down, back leaning against the wall of the maintenance shaft, head down, thinking. Min's legs are bent up and her arms rest on her knees. Asoka softly places her hand on Min's shoulder in a gesture of comfort. 

Min looks up at Rhee with a resigned smile. 

**Min: "You're totally right, you deserve to know before we go any further."**

**Min: "My name isn't Aramina Pedroso, and I'm not from the PETAR caves. My real name is Minka Oosou, and I'm a member of the Automata."**

Rhee's eyes grow huge. 

**Rhee: "Wait...the *Automata*?? I've heard of them...do you really live on the surface? Were you harboring Earthers who tried to run away from the work draft to build Space University?"**

**Min: "Yes, to both."**

**Rhee: "So then, is your head tatoo just a fake gang tatoo?"**

**Min: "It's a tatoo made of eSyrup...want me to show you?"**

Rhee nods, eyes huge with anticipation. 

### Page 3

Min stands and relaxes her subdermal shield out of stealth mode. Min's head tatoo melts into the far more elaborate pattern of her Automata clan tatoos, spreading across her whole body. The subdermal shield becomes more visible, giving her dark skin a metallic grey sheen. Min looks euphoric. 

**Rhee: "*Woooow!* That was...*beautiful*...!"**

**Min: "When I do that, I reconnect with every other member of my clan who has a subdermal shield. I just let them know that I'm well, and with good friends."**

**Rhee: "What's a subdermal shield? Why do you have it?"**

**Min: "It's what let's us live on the surface, instead of hiding in caves..."**

### Page 4

**"February 18, 2118: Amazon Rainforest"**

Bonfires on a warm night. Shadows of well-choreographed ritual dancers, powerful and strong from a lifetime of training, hover warmly, protectively. The view is zoomed out so that we see Min from above. Min is topless, sitting inside a large, fat metal hoop, a la Cyr Wheel. She is surrounded in many concentric circles of family and friends, all dressed in their most splendid clothing made of cloth infused with one of the AUTOMATA's original, surviving eSyrup cultures, called "Mothers". Everyone in the concentric circles are holding hands and focused on Min, their bodies convulsing in synchronised group ritual dance. 

Drum beats keep everyone synchronised.

**"Another Tree Surfer is born tonight."**

Over this backdrop, small close-up panels are scattered, showing different parts of 16 year old Min, a year before she leaves Earth, large swaths of skin covered in proudly displayed, ecstatically dancing clan tatoos:   
* an eye, nose, and ear. The eye is determined, steely, and dilated with adrenaline and euphoria. The nose and ear are pierced with eSyrup metal, formed into plain, elegantly raw shapes with rounded edges. The brow is set and only slightly sweaty. The head is shaved and covered in tatoos of her achievements as a clan member and Arborist. 
* a strong and straight back, dominated by an eSyrup tatoo depicting a shallow coral ocean scene, ever-changing.  
* shoulder and neck from the front, collar bone straight in a relaxed line that is perfectly parallel to the bottom edge of the panel. Neck is a bit clenched, and tendrils of Min's back tatoo curl around from her back in comforting, fractal patterns.  
* legs, covered in line art encoding her family lineage, are folded in an easy lotus, covered in the soft folds of ritual clothing appropriate for the ascent of a Journeyhume Arborist to the status of Expert Crafter: Tree Surfer. 

**"To be reborn, each Expert Crafter of the Automata must first retreat to one of the sacred caves and refrain from both speech and food for 7 days. Then, they must accept an injection of *raw eSyrup* into their *full skin*."**

### Page 5

3 panels show close-up views of the people in the inner most circle, just on the outside of the metal hoop:  

* Jina and Amadou, also covered in clan tatoos and splendid eSyrup ritual clothing. Jina's subdermal shield, marking her as an Expert Crafter, dance triumphantly in shadowy patterns under the clan tatoos. Next to her is a tall, beautiful eSyrup metal bucket, holding ritual clensing water.    
* Majhee, matriarch leader of their clan, subdermal shield barely visible beneath the many clan tatoos. She is proud, stern, and exhuberant on this day of achievement by her granddaughter.  
* Maraba, Min's cousin and dearest childhood companion, now an Expert Inker and chosen for the honour of injecting Min's subdermal shield. Next to Maraba, in a shallow curving basket woven from eSyrup kevlar, is an enormous syringe full of swirling, bubbling, raw eSyrup, freshly harvested from one of their original, surviving cultures, called "Mothers". 

**"DOOOOHM!"** 

The drums all come to a halt, and all of the concentric circles except the innermost lean in sharply on that last booming beat, hands all stretched towards Min, fingers shaking. 

Jina, Amadou, Majhee, and Maraba all stand up and pick up the metal hoop. They hold it in place as Min steps onto the curving metal, hands pushing against the hoop above her head. Then they strap Min's ankles and wrists to the metal hoop. 

### Page 6

Maraba picks up the syringe as Jina picks up the bucket of water, leaving Majhee and Amadou to hold the hoop with Min inside steady. 

Jina pours the bucket of water slowly over Min until Min is drenched, then returns the bucket to its precies, previous location in the circle. Then Maraba positions the needle of the syringe full of raw eSyrup against Min's right buttcheek, breaks the skin, and slowly injects all of the eSyrup as Min grits her teeth. 

Min's cousin pulls out the syringe and places it back on the basket. Then Jina, Amadou, Majhee, and Maraba turn Min in slow circles as the raw eSyrup spreads throughout her body, spreading up her torso, across her arms and legs, over her face, into her eyelids and nose and mouth. As the subdermal shield continues down her throat to line her lungs and gut, Min begins to cough and gag. 

### Page 7

Min's body convulses as her inner circle sets her upright in the very center again. 

The crowd chants **"Be Free! Be FREE! BE FREE!"** as Min finishes integrating the subdermal shield. 

After a tense moment, Min focuses her subdermal awareness to sprout razor sharp spikes at her wrists and ankles, cutting her bonds. The crowd roars with triumph. 

### Page 8

View from above: Min is on her knees, curled into a fetal position, cradling her bleeding wrists and ankles while her back tatoo writhes in distress. Jina, Amadou, and Majhee gently place the hoop back down in its exact previous position, centering Min again. 

Majhee stands at her original position in the inner circle. 

**Majhee: "Minka Oosou, daughter of Jina and Amadou, Tree Surfer of the Automata!"**

View of Min from the front, gasping, blinking away large beads of sweat from her eyes as she looks up at her grandmother.  

Majhee's eyes, proud, confident, expectant: "WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE FREE?"

### Page 9

Min closes her eyes, tries to calm her breathing, and struggles to stand. 

**Min: "To drink without bleeding, to breathe without choking, to see the sky and greet the day in my own skin..."**

**Min: "...and to MOVE in any direction with curiosity and grace..."**

Zoom in on Min's mouth, exhausted yet serene, confident, and defiant.

**Min: "...even OFF THE PLANET!"**

### Page 10

**"May 20, 2119: Amazon Rainforest"**

Min and Jina sit in comfortable silence, leaning against each other and watching the sunset. Min is showing off her counterfeit Universal Record, so that she can register for the ISE Corps without revealing the Automata. 

**Jina: "Haha, Aramina Pedroso, really? And now you will take our achievements into orbit, through this Space Asylum Scholarship. I'm so proud of my strong, smart, clever daughter."**

**Min: "Mom...do you remember Asoka, and João?"**

**Jina: "Of course! João saved my life, how could I forget them?"**

**Min: "Asoka is also going to the ISE Corps with me...

**Min: "...and they want to continue Eithne's work."**

**Jina: "I see."** 

Jina's hand clasps Min's hand, and their clan tatoos swirl against each other. 

**Jina: "Remember, no matter what happens, 'autonomous' doesn't mean 'alone'. I love you, Minaya."**

**Min: "Love you too, mom."**

### Page 11

**"Back on the Gemini Arboretum..."**

Rhee, Min, and Soka sit in the maintenance shaft. 

**Rhee: "So...you want to know how far Space Consortium's eSyrup research went?"**

**Min: "That's part of it."**

Min looks at Asoka and squeezes Asoka's hand. 

**Min: "Asoka's grandmother also conducted eSyrup research, and put it out of the reach of the Space Consortium by turning her research into a religion - the Biononymous. Soka's clothing is the result of her grandmother's research programme - how to let humans, who don't want to implant trackable, proprietary hardware into their bodies, use powerful digital computing technology."**

**Min: "But Soka's mother Eithne discovered a plot at the Green Havens, to turn crop plants into vectors for secretly injecting nano-biotrackers into people without their consent or even their awareness. Eithne gave up her life to fight this plot, and now that we've discovered the same plot here at the ISE Corps, both Soka and I are determined to finish her work, and find out who is behind this."**

### Page 12

**Rhee: "So that's why you always knew so much about basic eSyrup research...and I just thought you're a nano-materials nerd..."**

**Rhee: "...and that's why tracking down our mystery farmer is so important."

Rhee comes over to Min and Soka and hugs them. 

**Rhee: "Thank you for trusting me."**

Rhee turns to Min and gestures towards the secret airlock door.

**Rhee: "I guess you should get going, yeah?"**

## Chapter 6

### Page 1

**Min: "Did you already disable the ID register?"**

Rhee nods.

**Rhee: "I disabled it when I opened it. I just wanted an excuse to confront you about your identity."**

Min laughs, a big hearty laugh, then pulls Rhee into a heartfelt bear hug. 

Min then eagerly pulls herself through the airlock and looks around. She is in a large interstitial space that looks to be the whole length of the bridge, stretching darkly off into the distance. Min closes her eyes and uses her subdermal shield to see where human skin has touched the metal. A glowing path of hand prints travel off into the darkness. 

**Min: "Rhee, are you seeing this?"**

### Page 2

Rhee has re-activated her head info-sphere and is partway through the airlock. She smiles triumphantly, looking up through the bridge interstitial space towards Space University. Rhee daintily steps out of the tunnel, then wipes her hands with an eSyrup handkerchief attached to the inside of her left sleeve. Soka is right behind her. 

**Rhee: "Looks like the trail is hot again. Shall we send Iri ahead to scout?"** 

Iri squeels with delight and puffs up a bit with pride for being granted such a prestigious role. Iri detaches from Asoka, gives itself a little shake, then becomes invisible, blended to the surroundings. Iri's vision is already available to Soka, but Iri also throws its eyes to both Min and Rhee.

As Asoka climbs out of the airlock, Rhee flicks her fingers in another well-practiced gesture to turn her wrist info-spheres back on and begins to erase the airlock's memory of their entry. 

Asoka is wiping down the parts of the airlock that could have been touched by Rhee and Min, to prevent tracking. All three teens are floating in the much lower gravity of the bridge.

**Min: "Hold on...there's more than one person's hand prints in this space!"**

**Rhee: "Where?"**

Min, who has traveled up the bridge some distance, throws back her view of two handprints side-by-side, clearly of different sizes and texture. The one on the right is the same handprint they followed to find the secret airlock door; the one on the left is a smaller, more wrinkled hand.

**Min: "Oh no...I think I recognize this handprint..."**

**Rhee: "What? How??"**

Min carefully places her own hand next to the smaller handprint in the tunnel, to compare the size. 

==flashback==

The image morphs into two handprints in the dirt: one the same as the smaller, more wrinkled hand print in the bridge interstitial space; the other is Min's hand print. 

This flashback introduces PQ and shows us some of the work that Min has to do as a scholarship student: working on the farm, cleaning the public spaces of the Gemini station, cooking for the cafeteria. Rajue is also a scholarship student, and he and Min end up talking about Orbiter prejudices against Earthers, including the assumption that Earthers cannot handle the work of the Corpora Caelus guild. 

**Min: "I think our mystery farmer is working with PQ, head of the Gemini station service crew."

## Chapter 7













## Chapters 3-6

Jump ahead to 2119, Gemini Arboretum, home station of the ISE Corps. It is the day of Qualification Exams, when all first year trainees must take a "basic competencies" exam in order to advance to placement within a guild and begin their apprenticeship. However, Min, Asoka, and Rhee have other things on their minds. They have discovered that someone is transplanting crops around the Gemini station, and some of the new plants that are showing up in the Gemini Arboretum seem to be genetically modified to hijack human body processes to induce the production of nano-biotrackers. Min, Asoka, and Rhee have narrowed their list of suspects and are in hot pursuit of a shadowy figure through the interstitial depths of the Gemini station. 

Flashbacks establish how Min gets to Gemini station, how Min and Asoka meet, how they meet Rhee, and some of the daily mechanics of studying at the ISE Corps, especially as a scholarship student. Min and Asoka carry with them the legacy of their grandmothers, who both taught their descendents to be wary of Space Consortium and to fight the seduction of convenience that Space Consortium uses to pacify discontent. 

Asoka's mission on the Gemini, as declared to the Biononymous, is to learn more about the splicing process that is being used to turn crop plants into vectors for secretly injecting nano-biotrackers into humans without their consent or even awareness. If possible, Asoka will also try to understand who in the World Gov and Space Consortium are masterminding this plot. 

Min's mission on the Gemini, as declared to the Automata, is to discover just how advanced the proprietary eSyrup research of the Space Consortium has become. As the bearer of a subdermal shield, Min is a living embodiment of the pinnacle of Automata eSyrup research. 

While chasing the mysterious figure through the dark corridors, Min reflects on the choice she must make in order to continue living and studying on Gemini Station - which guild to declare an interest in? Her secret dream is to be a space swimmer, but space swimming is considered too difficult for Earthers, and Orbiters take great pride in their dominance at space swimming, to the point of severe prejudice in the apprenticeship process. Min has also done well enough in several other topics of study that she already has a number of offers from 3rd year trainees to recommend her to their guild. She has no such connection to anyone in the space swimmer guild, and Min wonders if she should go for their qual exam anyway. First-year trainees can take qual exams for up to 3 guilds, and their choices are usually determined by offers of recommendation by 3rd year trainees. 


## Chapter 7

Min, Asoka, and Rhee catch and confront the culprit, who turns out to be Tross, an ISE Corps alum and now a Journeyhume Space Swimmer at Space University. Turns out thought that he's been trying to replace the arboretum plants with better food crop plants, because his analysis showed that the students on Gemini were being under-nourished. Tross reveals a secret gardening project, hosted within the interstitial spaces of the Gemini station and supported by the chief of service crews, PQ. Min, Asoka, and Rhee reveal their mission and discuss with Tross the possibility that his secret gardening project has been infiltrated by a mole, and his efforts are now being hijacked to create ways of more closely surveilling ISE Corps students without legal or ethical oversight. 

In the end, they all join forces and agree to work together to untangle this greater mystery. Tross offers to give Min a recommendation to the space swimmer guild. PQ dubs them the Vigilante Intergalactic Roustabout Scholars.
