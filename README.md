This is where I'll be developing the story script for my graphic novel thesis. The thing below applies to everything in this repo:

## update, 06 Sept 2018
Stencila is proving difficult to use for collaborative script writing and sharing, so I'm going back to plain text/markdown for writing the script. 

## update, 03 June 2018
I'm now trying out Stencila to write my thesis. However, until Stencila develops a way for people to view and share files without downloading the Stencila Desktop app, I'll export final version of each "progress document" (1st draft, second draft, final draft, etc) into a markdown file, for easy viewing here on Github.
